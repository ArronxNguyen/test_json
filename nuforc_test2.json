wife was driving southeast on a fairly populated main side road, it was dark out side at about 6:43pm, And my wife exclaimed\u201d falling star baby look quick!\u201d When I looked up I saw not a falling star but a bright ball of light , one that was closer than any shooting star I have ever seen, it had a blue glow  changing into green colors of light as it fell from the sky. It fell as if falling from an invisible opening in the sky... the night was a crystal clear night sky  so no clouds or precipitation to obstruct our view and the object was closer than any I have ever witnessed before. The way the object fell was too slow to be a meteor or falling star, also noting that there was no \u201clight trail\u201d following behind the object as it fell. We watched it fall for about 5 seconds before it disappeared into the dark night sky somewhere close to the earth surface.  It was the strangest light; object; ufo... I have encountered and felt a duty to report it.","1":"I think that I may caught a UFO on the NBC Nightly News that aired March 21st or 22nd. In this short clip of a Boeing 747, as the plane flies left to right, you can see a black circular object flying eradicably (sic.  Erraticly)) behind the tail wing,  I\u2019m guessing at a distance of about 25-30 feet. If you slow the video down you can home in on the object more so.","2":"I was driving towards the intersection of fallowfield and eagleson when I saw a where streak in the sky like a falling plane or something.  I was shocked and it went down really fast towards the ground and disappeared.  Sorry for lack of details.  That is all I know.","3":"The object has flashing lights that are green, blue, red, and white.  The lights revolves around the object.  The object hovers in the same area for a long period of time. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thank you for responding.  The object seemed sphere or disc shaped.  The object was extremely far away, but we were able to see every color.  At one point a plane flew under the object and we were able to see how large it was in comparison.  It was at least two or three times the size of the aircraft.  The object ended up hovering for over an hour that we saw.  At one point the object dipped down and we noticed a smaller object below it that was similar.  When the larger object reached the smaller one, all of the sudden the smaller object disappeared.  We then noticed a large plane that flew under the large object flying North. The large object then suddenly disappeared. Please understand that I have never believed in UFO's nor do I believe in conspiracy theories.  This is a true account of what we have seen. I was not alone in seeing this object.  I do have a recording but my camera is so bad that it is difficult to see any of the colors that we saw on the recording.  Also, the object seemed much smaller in the recording than in real life.  If you would like for me to send you an attachment I will be more than happy to provide the documentation.  If there is an explanation for what was seen, please let me know. Thank you! ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

A-10\u2019s scrambled out of David monathin airbase. ??","5":"Apr. 10th we witnessed a very bright silvery round object hovering near zenith over our community looking like a very bright star. On Apr. 10th at aprox. 7pm we witnessed a very bright silvery round object hovering near zenith over our community looking like a very large bright star.  It did not appear to move for the 10 minutes it was observed in conflict with very strong winds.  It changed color from bright shinny to reddish as the sun was setting, made no noise, and was unobservable after the sunset.  2 photos were taken with each  looking totally different in appearance ... they were taken only 3 min. apart. The observers are all retired professionals.","6":"group of lights formation sweeping thru a night sky sigthing of strange group light almost transparent coming from going northward.  I found an video from youtube almost like what I saw of this group of light.I took a snip of this image from the video from mufon.  What i saw is exactly like that.  should you need the image capture from youtube image from mufon will gladly email it.  Just to prove what i saw, and maybe you can tell me if what I saw is authentic.  Philippines is the least place to experience this kind of unidentified object.  Again next time i will have a cellphone camera ready or any image capturing device.","7":"Metal orb of wires that was seen through a telescope after noticing a bright light that hovered in the sky for about an hour. Noticed a light in the sky that looked like an airplane, but never moved.  Proceeded to get telescope out and noticed a sphere that looked as if it was made out of wires.  Also noticed 2 black things inside of the center or at times one black thing and a tail on it.  No lights were on it and once the sun went over the horizon it was very hard to see.  There was 3 other of these lights in the sky very far apart from each other.   The whole incident lasted a whole hour but I am sure it was there for half an hour more at least. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))","8":"We think 2 UFOs....2 tiny lights recorded for about a minute.  We watched the top light bolt higher and then the lower light does an unbelievable semi circle motion.  Moved SO FAST like nothing I have ever seen before.","9":"I was driving and saw three glowing orbs is the best I can describe it.  I was driving trying to keep an eye on it and as I watched it, it just disappeared.  I also saw something else that could be related, it just didn't look right two lights almost looked like they were hovering and they did change location in the sky and were lower than the stars or what could be satellites, it did not look right to me","10":"There were 4 lights in diagonal formation that moved side to side to side.

While relaxing on my back porch after a long day of work, I noticed what appeared to be a flashing satellite.  The trajectory was circumpolar and velocity was consistant with average satellites.  The object was first noticed at the zenith.  The first flash was of approximately -6 magnitude brightness and lasted 3 seconds.  So far this seemed normal for a rotating solar paneled satellite.  Every 22 seconds the object flashed at a consistent magnitude until it disappeared over the northern horizon.  The odd thing is the flashing was consistent brightness as though the light was radiating all directions. Normal rotating satellites will flash at most twice before the change in orbital position relative to the observer makes the solar panels flash to a single spot on the earths surface.  The next flash would be hundreds of miles away from the observer one would th! ink.  This is the first time I\u2019ve seen this phenomenon and have seen thousands of satellites in my skywatching. This is my 23rd unexplainable sighting of aerial phenomena. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were sitting in our car near MacDonalds on Highway 50 in Spring Hill, FL (in the large shopping center).   We were looking north.  There was one object with different colored lights, one white, one a bright orange -- the orange light was so bright that we could not determine the object's shape.   There was another smaller cylindrical separate object without lights.  It moved around and then disappeared.  The first bigger object at the first was moving toward us and then started moving away from us and then it completely disappeared.   We watched this activity for about 10 minutes.

Strangely, overtones of interference were heard even though the default Voice Memos app shouldn\u2019t have been transmitting or receiving the sound data being recorded.  It was clear that the interference was correlated to the microphone input, and moving the device around the speaker produced feedback sounds in the amplifier.  This seemed impossible and was evidence that the phone was in-fact transmitting data that it \u201cshould not have\u201d been transmitting as the musician assumed the data recorded, stored, or played-back his Voice Memo application was protected. With the phone in the direct center of the speaker, he heard a ringing in his ears and was a bit confused \u2013 and had reason to believe this possibly caused an accidental distortion of spacetime itself.  Note this point:  He listened to an analog recording of the same moment, then walked outside to listen to it on his cell phone.  He noted the numerical number of the recording, and was surprised to hear that there were obvious time-domain distortions with the recording, and the pitch of the notes was shifted significantly and warbling in places.  He didn\u2019t imagine that the crystal-clock in the phone would be affected by the speaker, and was beginning to think that he had captured evidence of true time distortion. As he was outside listening, he noticed that the dogs were barking more frantically, and that the weather was changing rapidly \u2013 almost instantaneously.  As the wind got more violent, bugs began flying upward and leaves and small particles also began levitating or moving toward a general direction.  It really seemed to him that an immense force of gravity was pulling everything towards a point in the sky, and there was a loud electromechanical buzz which sounded like two separate electric motors.  Suddenly, a spinning saucer craft about 13-17 ft in diameter with a slowly revolving outer sheet-metal body appeared out of the very spot his eye was drawn to, and it swooped down to land a street or two over.  He felt the electromagnetic sounds through his feet as the device landed, and fled from the scene, leaving his phone. After returning some days later, he noticed that the recording he heard the time-distortion effects had been replaced with a recording that started at \u201cnote this point.\u201d  And had \u201ccontinued\u201d recording for over 7 hours, complete with the sounds of the craft captured and the sounds of him running through and locking his house even though he was not recording anything at the time.  Except that the \u201cplayback\u201d of the time distortion had been flipped out of phase and edited from this altered, replacement recording.  He heard strange sounds on the radio as well.

We were waiting in a gas line at Costco in Tucson when we noticed the man in front of us taking pictures of the sky where the daytime moon was located.  Upon exiting our car, we also looked up and saw 3 stationary objects in the area of the moon.  They looked silver as a plane would with the sun reflecting off the objects.   A minute later we looked up again and saw more had joined the group for a total of maybe 8 and all still stationary.  When we looked up minute or so later, they were gone.","34":"Colorful Night Sky Formation I walked out of dinner with two others and saw the most incredible sight in the night sky northwest of where we were and probably close to Sebastian.  It was a large formation in the sky with many twinkling lights.   Some of the lights were colorful and were rotating reminding me of a Spirograph design I had made as a child.  There seemed to be a brighter center object which emitted an orange \/red glow.  The lights swirled but then gradually came to center shrinking the formation significantly before dropping too low on the horizon to be seen.   I actually do not believe in the exsistence of UFO\u2019s but now my opinion has changed completely.  This did not resemble anything I have ever seen in the sky, in print or reported on before.

I noticed a very bright white light in the sky over the home to the west side of the street in the western sky.  Guessing it was about 10 miles away.  It was jerking back and forth, left and right, a very short distance at lightning speed.  I first thought it was my eyes screwing up.  Then it went at angles, and then zipped up and down.  Then an angle to the south and up and got super bright, then dimmer.   Yelling  for my wife to get the iPhone, I ran in the house, she had it in her purse.  By the time I got back out there it was not to be seen.  All of a sudden it appeared further to the north.  Then my wife saw it.  I could not get the iPhone to record fast enough.  Looked up and it sped off at a super fast speed.  Up and to the north and disappeared.","37":"6 lights seen in East Texas Moving strangely It was 22:28 Thursday the 14th this March.  I was waiting outside for my girlfriend to show up, and I looked up to take in the night sky.  I\u2019m used to aircraft flying over the area, it\u2019s semi remote, and off towards the Bivins area (south and slightly west of where I was) was a grouping of six lights.  000 000  At first I thought it was a drone, or some sort of aircraft, because Barksdale AFB isn\u2019t super far, and they have a lot of aircraft down there.  I watch it kind of slowly make it way south west, still not sure what to make out of it yet, and then it suddenly turns a sharp west, and slightly increased speed.  That was when I figured out that this wasn\u2019t some formation of craft, but a single, seemingly large craft, because the way it turned was like a zero turn mower if you improved their turning radius even more. The observer is an Army Veteran, and College student, majoring in Business Administration.","38":"It was sort of triangular-with rounded edges.  Saw it moving in different directions-not a huge distance-up and down,side to side.  At one point it seemed to move closer at which point I saw other flashes of light to the left of craft.  It was a smaller object very close to my neighbors roof-flashing white lights.  I almost thought it was a small drone but as soon the small one showed up, the large craft seemed to get farther and farther away.  Two raccoons also climbed on the my neighbor's roof looking to check it out.  Once lights disappeared the racoons climbed down the tree and I went inside as to not be in danger of them.  Hard to say in these times if we are seeing UFOs or drones or military craft however this one behaved very different as if traveling in flashes not mph.","39":"Orange pie shaped object At 3:48am saw an orange, pie shaped object that was stationary.  It slowly shrank in size.  As it got smaller it turned red and the object looked like a firefly.  It continued to get smaller until just a small circle and then gone. It never moved, just became smaller.  The position would have been over the Fort Harrison area.","40":"I was driving my car in an eastern direction and noticed a large bluish green light shaped like a ball moving smooth and extremely fast, much fast than a fighter jet approximately 10000 feet and there was no noise while it flew through the sky.

After a moment the star completely disappear a moment later.","43":"Flying light I went for smoke on the top of the building on the roof.

There was no sound with it and it was moving very slowly in what appeared to be a northerly direction.  My husband and I wanted to get a better look, so we got up and walked to the middle of our driveway.  The object hovered for a few seconds while we were in our driveway and it seemed as though when it knew we saw it, it vanished.  There was still no sound.

Except it was EXTREMELY bright and orange, and I went inside for two seconds and then turned around, and it was in the middle of the sky, much higher.  Then, I watched it, and it stayed in the same spot, not moving left, right, diagonally, anything.  Then it just dimmed in less than half a second and was gone completely right in its spot.

Three orangeish lights in a roughly triangular pattern, but the triangle was rotating and shifting as they generally rose up in the air.  I had my camera out already, shooting moonlight photos of the terrain, so I immediately began recording a video. There was no noise from them.  The light appeared to flicker sightly and slowly fade, though s I don't know how far they may have been I can't say this wasn't atmospheric distortion. After about two minutes, the lights were dim enough that my camera could no longer pick them up, though I could still see them myself.

I thought I saw a meteor, when I looked up, there were 2 round lights side by side coming out of the south west sky.  Moving much slower then a meteor, and faster then a plane.  They were a dull orange color with a haze around them, which was odd because the night sky was clear and bright.  The 2 lights moved at the same speed and same direction, but slightly changed distance from each other.  They traveled straight and then turned 90 degrees to the north east, and a few seconds later were gone.  They made no noise, and the light was constant, not blinking like airplanes. I saw them for about 10 seconds.","66":"Myself and my girfriend had just arrived home from working (both lawyers) and were pulling in the garage when I notice a top or diamond shape object motionless in the night sky.

All around it appeared to be lighteming type veins of different colors flash randomly..red, green blue,in lightening fashion.  It was dead silent as it hoover in one spot for a long time before slowly drafting in a southwest direct but stayed in our field of view.  After about, we notice two fast moving lights with jet like sound coming from east by northest direction which is the direction of a U.S. airforce base..when I looked back in the direction of the object, it was gone...jets came streaking by right where the object was before disappearing.

Close enough that I could see lights outlines the shape.  Stood for about 6 minutes watching it.  Came in to get binoculars and was gone when I came out.  Was letting dog out and heard a plane.  Saw this object with lights and thought it was unusual for a plane to have many colored lights on wings.  Saw a plane in the distance however, while this object was still hovering.","69":"My little dog was barking like crazy in the dogpen.  My big dog was inside and clawing at the backdoor.  I went to the backdoor to let my big dog out.  She wouldn't go out even though she had been clawing at the backdoor.   I exited the backdoor to bring in the little dog in the pen.  I walked about 1\/3 of the way to the pen, when I saw something red in the sky in the distance.  It was west of Lawrenceville but headed east.  It looked diamond shaped.   I continued to get my dog in the pen.  Then I look in the sky again and the object was no longer in the distance but was closer.  It came closer and closer and made absolutely no noise.  I had believed it was a helicopter or a very large drone at first.  But I heard nothing.  It finally came close enough that it appeared as a red diamond the size of my fist in the sky.  I then thought.... holy ((one word deleted)), this is a UFO.   I ran to the door and opened it and yelled to my wife \"Come here.  Come here.  UFO! UFO! Come see it.  I then run in the house and yell again.  My wife is snoring and almost snorting and she says leave me alone.  My 7 year old son comes sprinting out of his bedroom in his underwear and no shirt and says \"Show me, Daddy\".  He goes out back with me and it is leaving.  It was heading southwest but you could still see it through the canopy of trees.  It was now the size of a diamond shaped silver dollar in the sky and appeared to be getting smaller and then finally went black.  My son was amazed.  I wish he had seen it when it was the size of my fist in the sky.  One of the top 25 moments in my life.  I've always wanted to see one.  Who knows, maybe it really was alien in origin?","70":"Brilliant, boomerang shaped object in the distant sky, at sunset I was traveling towards the east\/northeast on Morgan Falls Road in Sandy Springs GA (Atlanta) on March 16 around 8:15 PM EDT.  I had been down at Blue Sluice Lake with my camera.  As I was approaching Roswell Rd, I could see a lovely sunset forming in my review mirror and decided to turn onto a side road that runs up to the local ball fields.  The road runs very close to high tension power lines where you can get a long view of the lines reaching toward the sun.  I've captured the sunset at this location several times in the past. I drove up to the ball field, turned around and drove back down, parking my car off to the side.  As I exited my car and crossed the road towards the tower closest to the road, I noted a very bright spot in the sky, as though the sun was reflecting from something.  It was off in the distance, irregular in shape with some small puffy clouds close by.  As I lifted my camera and zoomed in a bit I could detect sort of a boomerang shape.  I snapped a couple of photos, to be sure to capture the object before it could fade into the clouds, then I took a few seconds to adjust the camera.  It was getting dark, so I cranked the camera ISO up to 2000.  I didn't have a tripod for long exposure, so my pictures are a bit noisy. By the time I lifted my camera again, the small clouds around the object had dissipated.  The attached image was taken at 28 mpg, un-retouched, but resized for posting.  The excerpt was taken before resizing. Thank you.  Joan Hair","71":"((NUFORC Note:  Source of report provides no information.

A few seconds later it got really bright and flashed a blue light.  It sat there for another couple seconds and then started moving again in a different direction.  It repeated a larger blue flash this time and then seemed to have took off at a rapid speed.  The object was blue in color and oval.  This is not the first time I have seen this Blue Light Ship, it happens frequently. I would say at the very least I see the red basketball size orbs twice a week over Magnolia, Seattle.

About 50 yards from me and 30 ft in the air, was a shape that was dark and vibrating, or fluttering.  I first thought it was a bird, but then saw it shimmer, metalic.  It was small, about the size of a remote control plane, or a small drone, so I figured that is what it was.  I told my daughter what I saw, and she saw no one around, and reminded me we were in Amish country, where people don\u2019t use devices like that.  As we passed by it, I saw it in my rear view mirror, and turned around to see it again, but it was gone.  It wasn\u2019t a defined shape, but definitely wider then it\u2019s height.  It was fluttering, or vibrating, and hovering.  It was shinny metal, and dark.  I have never before seen anything like this.

I explained that I have a night vision video camera that I set up most nights in my back garden. To date there has not been a night where I have not picked up a number of items that are not planes and not satellites.  I own two telescopes and hope to get a close up of one of the many things I have Seen along with my wife. The last four times I have set this up and left it alone for a few hours we are getting orbs flying close over the top of the camera. at first I thought it was maybe leaves blown by the wind, but we are now getting them from all directions even when thre is no wind at all, then we realized that there are o leaves and besides they are too big and they are lit from the inside, tonight this has happened more than a dozen times and all at a remarkable speed, almost fast enough to produce a comet tail effect. I am still getting just as many objects as ever. I am at present trying to set up my telescopes, one with a special cctc camera that has been modified to collect light, but doing this as you will be ware will reduce the area of sky I cover and any given time, however it will I hope be lucky enough to give a clearer picture of the object, and with about twenty or more a night we should get lucky. this new thing with these orbs has happened before but not in the number we got tonight, the camerai am using still gives a night sky but one can actually see the clouds and their form all in a black and white picture. the area where we live does have a record when it comes to U.F.O.s  and my interest is getting solid proof, however, with the addition of these lights I am wondering what comes next, we have been able to get a reaction to a flashing tourch where the signal is copied very clearly, which does not happen with satellites, besides they do not change direction in flight as these objects can do. I am a little concerned as I do not think that we are prepaered for first hand contact, so would be grateful for some advise regarding this possibility. I have been interested in this subject for many years, hence the use of good telescopes good enough to pick out interesting items on the moon that tend to be out of line with reports from NASA. I would be grateful for some advise  concerning the above","80":"MADAR Node 106","81":"MADAR Node 110","82":"At approximately 5 am, i went to let my dog out my back door which faces north.

I was parked in my car at Port Republic Park in New Jersey.  I was returning emails and phone calls for work, when I looked across the water and saw a black helicopter moving very slow, almost just hovering at about a hundred feet in the air.  I watch this for 15 minutes or so.  At this point the helicopter was too loud for me to talk business on the phone so I decided to leave.  As I drove around down  the road the helicopter was coming my way so I pulled off to the side and waited for it to come to me.  As it got closer all the dirt wind sticks and leaves we're being blown all around me.  Being this close I was able to get a good look at the helicopter.  It was all black no markings at all, no numbers or letters or names.  There was a person in a jumpsuit sitting outside the helicopter taking photos.  There was another car doing the same thing I was but I never talked to him.  I was so fixated on the helicopter I almost missed it.  I noticed above the helicopter a sphere with multiple flat sides like a hexagon.   The sphere was spinning slowly and hovering or moving very slowly at this point. I could see  the sun  bouncing off  the flat metallic  sides  as it spun.  I'm not sure if the helicopter was aware or not.  At this point I took out my phone and videotaped but had noticed the sphere was gone from my site.  At this point I continued to follow the helicopter at about 10 miles an hour or slower.  I could clearly see the person in the helicopter taking photos and at one point of me and my car so I thought I better leave.  When I got home and took a look at the video I realized that the sphere was in the sky but had just had moved more to the right. Unfortunately my phone video did not do it justice.  That being said I did document the strange event as you can see.  When you look at the video enlarged  and slow down and you will see the object appear in the bottom Circle then in one frame jumps to the second Circle.  I don't know how long 1 frame is but that seems ungodly fast to me.  If it wasn't for seeing that jump I may have just wrote it off to a strange sighting that could have been anything.  Please analyze and clear up my video as I did the best I could with what I had.","86":"Shiny sphere in the clear blue sky for 6-7 seconds then disappeared.","87":"Machine-like humming heard Woke up to a loud humming and machine-like rumbling.  But didn\u2019t sound like anything I\u2019ve heard before.  It was loud right outside my window, and right when I woke up, it sounded like it flew away.  And I could hear the hum of the ufo after it left.  Very deep pitch.  As it flew away, the pitch of the hum went up and lasted for a few minutes.  And then later in the night, the sound came back for a couple minutes, and was gone again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Apache and Durango,  The Lakes Business Park   So I was watching the moon and noticed hey the moon doesnt look right with this warping quality.  The moon appeared to be peeling and shimmering at the edges sort of like how hot blacktop distorts what you see with the heat convection, but in a way that made me uneasy.  So I thought hey maybe I should see if my camphone can capture what I was seeing.  I zoomed all the way in and aimed the camera and found a steady position and this took around 30 seconds to prepare.  Video quality was junk because my phone wasnt created for long distance zoom but I pressed record anyways.  The only object in the clear sky that I could see with my camera up to that point was the moon, but as soon as I pressed record, literally within milliseconds of activating the record function, this tiny white dot appeared traversing in front of the moon.  I held my steady position suddenly full of excitement that this could be a UFO.  I couldnt actually see it with my eyes but the camera picked it up fine.  This thing is obviously high altitude.  At first I thought it was a huge coincidence that I basically got ready to film a UFO without knowing it.  Sent me for a loop.  Distance was very difficult to determine but whatever it was it was definitely very high altitude.  Difficult to not think it was actually at the moon itself, but if it were at the moon it would need to be exceptionally bright and large to shine through the daytime blue sky. UFO?  Plane?  The ISS?   The recording is 48 seconds long.  The object approaches the moon from the right at around 51% up from the bottom of it in a straight line with a slight descent and then disappears.  It then reappears hovering for a fraction of a second on the left side of the moon inside that darker area as though it materialized out of nothing.  You can clearly see it didnt fly straight through solidly, the contrast of the dark patch on the left side of the moon makes it easier to see.  It then continued its path in the same direction behind the bare branches of the nearby tree.  I filmed it till it left my line of sight. It appeared to pulsars somewhat and with the lower resolutions you can see this pulsating more clearly.  I rewatched this Video a hundred times and truly its easy to obsess over because they I filmed this thing and its exciting.  My camera phone is a plain common android smart phone, nothing fancy.  I am sending you the whole 48 second video.  What I already posted online is a shortened 10 second version. I have seen It is of various sorts several times before. Last ones were 2015, 2 in 2014, here in Las Vegas, a whole bunch of them in 2011 and 2012 in Los Angeles and first one was 1994 in Oregon when I was a young kid.  This would be my first actual filming of a UFO in my whole life and funny that it was fully through chance and coincidence and perfect timing. I tried reporting this on the MUFON site but there is an error and forms cannot be submitted. I also tried sending the whole video but since it is 100.38MB and my email limit for attachments is 24MB I decided to upload it to Vimeo and peovide the link.

The time was around 9:30 PM as we were fishing when me and one of my friends caught a glimpse of a green orb object travelling in a west-to-east at an estimated 65 degrees south of us in the night sky from where we observed it.   The object was travelling at a high rate of speed and as it passed it appeared to be moving in a loose zig zag pattern, after it passed us it appeared to change trajectory more downwards, when suddenly what can best be described as a \"flame-out\" occured, in which the object was briefly covered in flames and appeared to burn out before vanishing in thin air.

The BOOMERANG-shaped object was always shining with faded colors of a rainbow, like a LED light that just shows faded colors if you know what I mean, I have one that's why I can relate easily.

I was looking off the balcony west to east towards Tyndall AFB when I spotted what I thought was the reflection of something in the air.  I estimated it to be approximately 15 miles away and approximately 20,000 feet AGL.  I realized the object I was seeing was not moving. I have 22 years in the us air force, and have over 2000 hours flying on helicopters, so I initially thought I was seeing something hoovering, and possibly something from the nearby Tyndall AFB.  I began taking photos of it and a short video.  The pictures are a sequential series of about 100 photos and show the object to have a lot of movement but it is not going anywhere.  I used a zoom lens on a new a6000 sony and did not check the photos at the time.  Later when I downloaded them to my laptop I realized I had captured some very extraordinary pictures of something I had never seen before.  Over the course of the two hours I t! ook photos the object appears to be an advanced aircraft with straight lines and horizontal stabilizers, to a rocket shaped object traveling at a very high speed, what appears to be concentric rings of a contrail, and finally what appears to be a huge luminescent stingray or butterfly with straight line edged wings on both sides. In another series of photos it is obvious the object has made itself to appear invisible by reflecting the surrounding blue sky. I have not posted any of these photos yet. I know this all sounds crazy, but I have actual photos of everything I have mentioned. I have uploaded the video to youtube and can be seen there.

I have caught many ufo crafts this 1 appears very faint then appears fully then is gone within a second...had to slow the video down to see that it was a craft..","111":"disc-shaped craft at high altitude over highlandtown lake. it occurred when i was sailing on highlandtown lake, but i did not have my damn camera.  the date is only an estimate, roughly around that day, but i remembered the time it happened...and the details are clearly remembered and are thus:  it was at a higher altitude than the jets, and larger, and moving much faster. (i would estimate the speed at slightly above the sound-barrier, but it did not make a sonic boom, could have been too high.)  the object was round, and black, and cast a round shadow that was probably at least 300-500 feet in diameter on the thin wispy cloud layer it was above, it may have been perhaps at 30-50,000 feet. there were lower aircraft at the time, perhaps ten to 20,000 feet, but not in same area. it traveled in a straight line, nearly perfectly north to south, then began to turn to the south-southeast. there were multilayered cloud formations. large cumulous clouds were developing, though the weather was fair. i lost sight of it when it passed over a large cumulus cloud, did not see it emerge from other side of that cloud, though i should have seen that occur. it was silent, also, but the noise of the wind, out of the north, and water as i was sailing on the starboard tack on a beam reach at a pretty good clip on my tahitian outrigger, could have obscured the sound. moreover, i do not do drugs, nor do i smoke or drink, nor do i hallucinate.

I take the dogs out pretty late every night so they don't wake me up early.  My wife and I like to look up at the stars because we live drop in the woods with very little light sources to ruin the view.  I noticed one light when my wife noticed another.  We both followed the light until we realized they were headed toward each other.  A third came into view as they got closer together.  They converged abs formed a triangle for a few seconds before taking off in different directions than they came.  I told my wife pick one and watch it while I watched another.  She lost hers behind the trees.  Mine flew over the house towards the front.  I followed it until it was out of sight.  Then, right where the light went out of sight an extremely bright blue light appeared from nowhere and moved at an incredible speed from left to right in my field of vision.  My wife was standing right next to me and ! saw it as well.  We both stood there for many moments astonished at what we had witnessed.  I was in the military for eight years and have knowledge of aircraft.  This was nothing that I've ever seen before.  Now we watch the sky above our house as much as possible.","113":"Three white lights that were brighter than the stars converged above my house.

A jet flying at a high altitude, leaving contrail was flying east to west to the south at a distance.   The object moved across the sky in a matter of seconds towards the jet.  It followed the jet from behind for a few seconds.  It then moved at high speed to the east and disappeared.","115":"Low Flying Object seen flying over my backyard at low speed. I was in my backyard with my dog and looking at the night sky.  I could hear the high altitude planes flying overhead.  The sky was dark, clear with a few clouds.  A dark color, cone shaped object flew over my house, over my back yard and over the tree line at slow speed.  The object disappeared over the tree line.  The direction of travel was approximately SE to NW.  The object was completely silent and there were no lights.  I don\u2019t know if cone shape is the right description but it was like a very narrow triangle or very long spear shape.  The object was as long as a commercial airliner and in my estimation it was flying at about 3,000 to 5,000 feet above ground level.  We have a large airport about 20-25 miles away and a small commercial airport about 2 miles from our house.  The object flew lower than any aircraft I usually see flying around my house.  I don\u2019t ever recall seeing any night flying in and out of the small airport that is near our house. I served over 20 years in the military and been around many aircraft at night.  I also served over 19 years as a police officer and worked near the major airport in Charlotte.  I have never seen anything that looked like this and flew as slow as it did without making a sound.

Off to the right edge of my windshield I noticed a flashing light come into my field of view.  It was traveling from my right side to the left, its direction of travel was to the north-east.  Because I was traveling 70mph down the hwy I could tell its distance from me was less than a mile, when I first saw it to the end I had gained distance on it and it seemed closer than at the beginning. \tSo the light was pulsing in a binary condition, meaning full on and fully off at about 4-5Hz (times a sec), and the on period was the same as the off period, it wasn't like the flash strobe of an airplane where you have the quick flash, then long off period and the quick flash again.  The light stayed the same throughout the sighting. \tThe path of the light went pretty much horizontally from my right, over above the field to the right of the hwy, crossed over the hwy and over to the left side of the highway over some wooded area roughly 1\/2mi off the hwy taking approx 4-5 seconds, it was moving very quickly. It was very low the entire time, I estimate it to be below 500ft.  My work base is very close to MSN airport and I see air traffic everyday at low altitude, I also know it is against the rules to fly that low (below 500ft agl) without a really good reason.  While the light was to my left just over the wooded area 5-6 bright lights dropped from the original flashing light, this took less then a second.  These lights were constantly lit and they seemed to fall strait down until they were now obscured by the trees in the forest. \tI am now watching this from my side window, with the window down.  Almost immediately after the lights dropped, the original flashing light turns its direction of travel to near vertical and keeps climbing until it looks like it goes into the clouds and I cant see it anymore.  The 90 degree turn was very quick and it didn't appear to be in an arc at all, it was just suddenly going up.  During this time its so close I had to stick my head out the window to look up to keep it in my sight. \tDuring this whole thing I'm thinking this is an F-16, and I try to hear the engine, and I should have been able to see the glow of the exhaust.  I don't hear anything or see the exhaust, I've been to a few airshows and when jets go into a vertical climb it is very loud below it, and their pretty much giving it full throttle to maintain that climb.  I also know that I can hear F-16's taking off while I'm driving my truck with the windows rolled up as it is quite a frequent occurrence when I am driving near MSN\/Truax field.  I watch them takeoff at night sometimes and they always have a white strobe and their red\/green wing lights along with orange glowing exhaust. \tAfter I couldn't hear the engine, that's when I realized I needed to note the time and my location.  I knew Volk field was somewhat near so that night I looked it up, turns out its actually over 55mi from where I was.  Google maps sat view only shows farm fields, no bombing ranges. And if it was a jet fighter dropping flares, why was it flying a few hundred feet above hilly ground dropping flares into a wooded patch in a farmers field surrounded by farm houses less then a mile away from an interstate highway in near pitch dark.","118":"Daytime oval object over Northern Michigan caught on video.

I was driving home from airlift one day,  I had my head out of the window because I was sweating and I turned to look up at the stars and I see this circular thing hovering with multiple different colored lights covering it.  I stared at it fir a good 3 seconds then turned to my friend who was sitting in the backseat next to me and told him to look at it, seconds after he had seen it, it was gone.  We looked at each other after and we so freaked out ..  Then we turned down this road and I had my speaker playing before, but I turned it off, I turned the speaker back on and it said something in a whinny woman\u2019s voice then it just shut off.  i asked if anyone else in the car had heard it, my friend beside me had and so did his mother they both claimed it was a woman\u2019s voice before I said anything to them about what I heard. When I arrived back at my house no one was home my sister at a friend's house and my mom at work, so I was a bit scared.  I called my friend to talk to her about it (different friend from before) and she had said that she had been hearing noises almost like a plane flying close to the ground, right above her house it just kept on going.  Then she heard a Big Bang pretty close to her house and saw a flag of light which I saw with her over FaceTime but when she looked out the window nothing was there, and that\u2019s when the noises stopped.","123":"June 28 2019 a UFO was caught on my deer camera.

This is the truth. I was on my way home from Northern Maine. There was a hitchiker with me, I looked in the rear mirror.  Noticed we were being followed. It looked like a motorcycle light, but orange.  I could approximate the the distance behind me at between from 1\/4 to 1\/2 miles behind me.  I could not determine the size, but it was orange, not white. The hitchiker saw it too. It was just a red-orange light behind us.  Orange mostly, and sort of bright. It made a right turn without a road exit, it had a tail, and just disappeared.","126":"Two objects apparently the same size, shape, color, movement sitting in the same place, one for thirty-five days, the other the same. I am a retired school teacher of 42 years.  I have an MEd in Administration and Supervision.  I am 74 years old. On Monday, July 1, this year, I was on my deck attached to my home.  At approx. 21:00, I was watching the sky at dusk, watching commercial airliners fly directly over my home, flying east to west.  My home is directly under airliners' flights apparently from Philadelphia\/New York to the west coast.  As an airliner went across the sky, I saw an object off to the side of it.  At first, I thought it was a star and didn't pay any attention to it.  As the plane moved forward, I saw this \"object\" start to move at about a ninety degree angle directly toward what I realized was an intersect point with the plane.  Now, I could see that the object was not a star as it was close to the earth.  The object had ball-like pieces that moved around as the object moved toward the plane.  The balls were different colors with three white ones that moved around the outside of the others.  From where I stood, the object was going to run directly into the plane.  The plane continued, the object stopped as the plane passed, evidently the two were not at the same altitude.  The object then made a ninety-degree left turn at an apparent high rate of speed.  If the plane was moving at 400 mph, the object was moving at about the same rate toward the plane, made that turn, then followed the plane at the same speed for a short time.  At that point, I became aware that the object was not alone.  A second, similar object \"appeared,\" and I say appeared because it was not there a second before.  The second object was farther to the east.  It was not as well \"put together\" as the first as the second had similar round parts, but they were not organized into a shape as the first was.  The second approached the flight path of the plane but behind it.  The object seemed to get organized as the lights formed, it appeared, a flat object.  The object followed the plane, apparently tracking it or staying behind it, toward the west until it disappeared.  In th! e meantime, the first object moved erratically in one place wh! ere it s topped following the plane, the ball-like structures moved around inside the shape, changed colors, and appeared to form a large sphere-shaped object that was \"rolling.\"  After maybe fifteen minutes, the object began to move upward, away from the Earth.  Today, thirty-five days later, the object \"sits\" in the sky in the same place, but much farther away from the Earth.  It sits there, still observable with the un-aided eye, with the \"balls\" of light moving around in random motion.  And, the total object, moves, apparently randomly, from my observation point, left, right, up and down in the sky.  A second object, I do not know if it is the same second object as I saw the first night, now sits at apparently the same altitude but more to the western sky.  Its movement is observable left, right, up, and down, apparently random.  Its balls of light move in the same way as the first object.   I have observed these objects nightly when it is not too hazy or cloudy.  The first one is in the same place as the first night, and the second object sits at about the same place as it was after tracking the plane.  Am I nuts?  No.  I am observing an obviously controlled object in the sky.","127":"My fiance and I were watching fireworks all around us.  We looked over to mount San Antonio, when we saw 3 orange lights moving slowly right above the Mountain.  I tried to take video, but it didn't show up very well.  It lasted approximately 6 minutes and just disappeared.","128":"Fireballs flying across sky then burned out. My fiance and myself went to the westport marina to watch the fireworks at approximately 10 pm on july 4th 2019 when we noticed a ball on fire floating across the sky, but spinning it would burn out after a few minutes but stay solid black flying like it had a purpose towards the ocean towards ocean shores then after it was almost out of view we noticed two more following the first one doing exactly the same thing making absolutely no noise. It wasn't fireworks I'm sure.  An older army vet next to us witnessed this too he said he never saw anything like that in his life he said it didn't look military or like a drone.","129":"Light, size of a distant star, distinct movements in fast  horizontal line, stopped, returned to starting point in opposite direction, also made vertical and zig zag movements","130":"Saw a rectangular shaped ufo glowing orange during an ocean crossing. During an ocean crossing from Bermuda to Florida.. 4:30 am 240 miles away from the Bahamas it was a flat calm night.  The moon had gone over the horizon so it was pitch black other then the boats bright light facing forward.  The light gave us around 50 feet of visibility ahead of us.  We were cruising at 10 knots.  An orange glowing rectangle about the size of a refrigerator appeared just outside of the boats light.  This object was hovering over the water around 5-10 feet.  Created no wake and was silent.  We turned off the boats light and sure enough it was illuminated, we could see the sharp right angles very clearly!  This thing was close!!  We turned the light back on and the object took off out of site In front of the boat.  This left everyone confused.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was flying right above the ground, and right in the middle, it had a round glass that hung down  and was flashing.  It made no sound at all.  I was so taken aback.  I didn't even stop to take a picture.  I have looked and researched shiny silver planes that fly low to the ground taking pictures, but can\u2019t find anything matching my description.  I will never forget what it looked like and what it was doing.","132":"A few orange orbs appeared to make a formation along with another group, totaling around 10 orbs.","133":"The rocket was was black with burnt coloring or cinder on it.  It moved soundlessly in a way that seemed to not catch the eye. The object was rocket shaped with a sharp nose that had short long fins.  It was black and seemed to have an ash or burnt look about the surface.  The object was about 20 feet from the passenger side of the car window.  It was traveling east to west along the Chicopee River.  Its speed seemed slow in a strange unnoticeable way. The object caught my attention because he said,\"I think I just saw a UFO\".  I looked to my right and the object appeared.  When I said,\" Its like a black rocket, he said no it was a bright flash in the sky.","134":"HUGE SHIPS  AT LEAST 20 MILES IN DIAMETER SEEN IN THE SLC AREA FROM 1-330 AM AT LEAST FOR THE PAST  16 WEEKS NOW ABOUT 2-3 TIMES PER WEEK.","135":"UFO questionable on Highway 145 heading south to Cortez, Colorado San Juan mountain range On July 15th 2019 while on a trip to Cortez, Colorado, heading south on Highway 145 San Juan Mountains range, I stopped and started taking pictures of the mountain peaks with my Nikon 5600 camera with a Tamron 28-400mm lens which equals a 600mm on the Nikon and with my Samsung Note 9.  After the trip I had been going over my photos taken on the drive I noticed this black object in the sky on pictures with the Nikon and the Samsung Note 9. With Samsung I was doing a panoramic of the mountain peaks and I noticed in one of the panoramic photos there is this black object.  At first I thought it was a bird or a plane, though at the time I did not hear or notice any noise or this black object.  With closer inspection and at the distance I was taking the photos, it couldn\u2019t have been a bird I think..  It would have been to tiny.  So I\u2019m perplexed as to what I\u2019m seeing in these photos. I have a raw file from the Nikon, and the ones attached are jpg\u2019s. with no edits.  I have image information on the exif. Thanks for any information if you think there is something to these photos and I will circle the photos of said object on separate photos.","136":"One white circle traveling incredibly fast above Eufaula, Oklahoma.   Me and 8 other people were on a boat outside of Belle Starr marina in Eufaula, Oklahoma, and looking at stars when we saw a bright light traveling across the sky moving too fast to be a plane and blinked twice and disappeared.","137":"On a flight back to Hartford, Connecticut, from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, we started our initial descent towards Hartford, Connecticut, I believe this was over New Jersey.  I was filming a jet far off and a distance going left to right out of my window.  After I said the words the 15 minutes natal small white light appeared in the top right part of the video.  It hovered for a few seconds maybe 3 and then floated down in disappeared to the right.  About 2 seconds later, 3 bright objects information flew from right to left and in an upward angle extremely extremely fast. I do not believe this could have been a light reflection from inside my plane although it could be.  I don't know maybe you looking at the video and slowing it down could probably decide that period.  Thank you","138":"Object with two lights moving up and down in back yard. One of our security cameras picked up a 10 second video of an object floating up and down in our back yard. Because it was approximately 3:30 am it was dark so all that could be seen was two lights which were rectangular in shape.  My husband and I thought it was a drone, but when we turned the sound up all that could be heard was crickets and night insects.  A raccoon was on the side of the shed out of view of the object and didn\u2019t seem to be aware of it. It started about half-way down the side of the shed, then slowly came down a little lower and then went up slowly and the video stopped when the object reached a height just above the top of the shed. A video captured 11 minutes previously showed nothing unusual and I have seen nothing like it before or since. ((ADDENDUM\/RETRACTION SUBMITTED BY SOURCE OF REPORT)) Mistake I think my \"UFO\" is some kind of camera anomaly because I have found another video with a very similar (although not nearly as big) capture.

When I videoed the sight, the lights pulsated every 2 seconds for a period of 35 minutes in the same spot.  Very unusual sighting.  I was told by a local newspaper reporter that a pilot has also reported the same type of sighting 2 hours earlier about 25 miles away from my location.","141":"bright white light traveling from west to east, grew very bright at one point then went back to original brightness. Was looking at Venus and noticed a bright star appear slightly above it in motion.  It just looked like a bright light moving from west to east. It was around a full moon, so we were surprised when all of a sudden it got way brighter at one time.  Then, it moved pretty smoothly other than one time when it made a dip and then a jerking motion then leveled back out. we got a good look at it through the binos and it looked like a saucer shape with two lights towards the center.  It also looked like it had a huge dome top that was a very odd shape and almost came to a rounded point at the top.  My husband and I watched it go over the horizon and even had time to point it out to my daughter.  Gave me the chills when it grew brighter out of nowhere, because it got so much brighter.  Object was silent, and for as low as it was, it should have made some sort of noise but didn't.","142":"Hovering orbs.

We looked up into the night sky and saw the big dipper and we noticed a bright orbital light traveling from south west.   Moving across in a east north east  direction.  It was traveling at a constant speed and seemed to waver a little bit at least it looked as if it was wavering in the sky.  it moved eastward until it was completely out of sight over the mountains.  it was higher in the night sky than an jet airplane and it was moving faster than any plane because we observed a plane going by from the south to the north end at the same time. I thought it might be the international space station but I checked the times and it was not supposed to be traveling overhead until after 1 am 5 adults and  1 child witnessed the event.","145":"For 30 min, early morning, two people saw an oval light about 30 ft wide, circling, and shinning down through a sparse cloud cover. At 16:00 I went outside into my back yard to locate the source of carpenter ants that have been entering our home. Having found the entry to the nest, at about 16:30 I decided to sit down on a recliner and watch the passing cloud cover. Just when I looked up (facing south) I was surprised to see a light circulating overhead. I estimate that the overhead cloud cover was about two to three thousand feet high, and of varying thickness, with occasional open areas, which made it possible to temporarily glimpse the three-quarter moon, a planet and some stars, and an airplane that flew by. The light was definitely coming from above the clouds.  I estimate the size at about thirty feet. I observed it from an angle of about forty-five degrees.  The light appeared as a glow shinning downward through the clouds.  (To verify, I looked over the backyard wall toward the horizon to see if there was any light that was shinning upwards-there was none.)  (Also, this could not have been a search helicopter, since there was no sound and a search helicopter would not be operating above the cloud cover, and the light was not shinning through the clouds with enough intensity to light up anything on the ground two to three thousand feet below.)  The light traveled, counter-clockwise, in an oval of about several hundred feet (perhaps 400-500 ft.) wide.  It took about seven seconds for the light to complete a full oval.  From my perspective, the light appeared to be moving in an oval pattern.  The light kept circling in the same location; but, it wasn't in a perfect oval; there was some slight deviation from a perfect oval pattern.  The light may have been a circle and its movement may have been a circle had I observed it directly overhead, but from my perspective it appeared oval. I watched the light for about fifteen minutes.  I awakened my wife; and we watched the light together for about fifteen minutes. There was no sound associated with the light.  At about 16:50, a much higher passing airplane (perhaps a two-engine) became intermittently visible through the thinning cloud canopy. It was clearly heard as it passed by. At 17:02 the onset of sunrise began to brighten the sky and the light faded from view, and we returned back inside of the house. I did not feel any connection with this light. I did not feel any emotions, other than calm curiosity. The following morning, at about 16:00, with the cloud conditions about the same, I looked in the same direction for about forty-five minutes, but I did not see any light as I did the morning before. And the following early Sunday, with the cloud conditions about the same, at about 15:00 and again at about 16:30, I looked in the same direction for about fifteen minutes, but I did not see any light as I did the week before.","146":"While in our swimming pool, we looked up and suddenly saw 2 red round objects swiftly and quietly flying by our house.

Night, in parking lot, look up and in sky fairly high and little distant is a little oval cloud barely moving, but a little . every 15 second it would pulsate blue with a dark blue line just inside the oval.  Like an arc light.  Then suddenly beams, dark fire engine red color, more like streamers popped out of one side and then slowly disappeared.  Only once.  Was it trying to communicate with me?  These red plumes were like slow moving  fireworks.  Turned around for one minute, and then it was gone.","148":"Blue UFO Drops Object Exteme Close Up Video It was recorded from a phone camera.

This next night my spouse was away on business...I stepped outside for a cigarette...I noticed Flashing lights in the sky...tried to take a picture or record it. Video recording shows object spinning in sky.  Also photos appeared to have red tint...reverted photos back to normal that shows disoriented photo...the next photo show object in neighbors yard with foreign entities in helicopter shaped object.

I have no memory of the actual abduction, but do have missing the.  This abduction also occurred 4 days before my 1st ever UFO sighting.  The UFO sighting had multiple witnesses as well.  I went to bed watching TV on my phone.  I do this often and charge the phone while I do it so it's fully charged when I wake up.  An hour and 45 minutes later I tell myself in my sleep that I need to wake up.  I just feel like I need to awaken and feel panicked.  I wake up and immediately reach for my phone.  But it's dead, but charging at 1%.  It cannot die on the charger?  And even had I not been charging it, it would not have died watching TV for only an hour and 45 minutes.  Even if it had died, how could it be charging suddenly?  I had an uneasy feeling like I had missed time. I have a guy feeling that I was abducted and grabbed my phone just as they took me.  They had me long enough my phone died. I was returned and my phone put on the charger just as I woke up.  I didn't really believe this until I saw an actual UFO a few days later.  Now I'm extremely nervous to be by myself now.  I also have had a strange and small bruise on my right armpit.","153":"Cluster of lights which changed colors and a group of red lights that seemed to be targets. d openly talked about a Space Military possibly be already created and what I saw was it in Practice?  This was My theory at least after thinking about it for two days  I do not do drugs have not even had a aspirin in 20 years  Do not drink and I am not a Nut job.  But what I saw is driving me crazy trying to understand what I saw and Hope it being reported to you will help You Guys figure it out and maybe one day you can say what it was to the Public in General I will be watching for a answer.In looking at the questions Below May I add these lights were in outer Space not that close to Earth Possibly Hundred or Thousand of Miles away they were mostly a group of Light points and the same for the red Lights.  so I had no way of telling How really big they were.","154":"Objects Hovering Facing south at intersection of CTY F and CTY K in Sussex, Wisconsin.  Looked up and noticed 2 objects to the south - one below and left of the other, at about 20 degrees from horizon.  At first thought they were helicopters hovering over an intersection on interstate 94 as this happens when there are accidents.  Proceeded to drive in that direction, glancing up occasionally to see if they were still there.  At on point, after about 4 minutes, saw them, glanced down at my speedometer, looked back up and they were gone. Objects were rock steady and did not move. No sound. Could not ascertain size as they were too far away.  Objects were about the size on an aspirin held at arms length. Checked with nearby airport.  They stated there were no helicopters in the vicinity.  Also checked with local TV stations to see if they use drones, they do not. Myself and owner of gas station witnessed this.","155":"MADAR Node 128","156":"MADAR Node 128","157":"MADAR Node 130","158":"MADAR Node 141","159":"I was at work out in the train yard when I noticed in the sky a cigar-shaped object slowly flying south west of my location.

We live in a rural area.  There is a large open field behind our home.  I was filming the lightening.  I set my phone to video and slow motion.  I was on the back patio.  All the lights and the TV were off in the house.  I pointed my phone up in the sky and did a 26 second slow motion recording.  When I reviewed it, there appears to be a strange craft that I did not see when filming.  It is somewhat diamond shaped and has flashing white, blue and amber lights.  The fact that I did not see it makes no sense to me because it was pitch black out.  People think it may be a drone but it does not look like a drone to me.  Very strange.

Pilots always look up when they hear an aircraft overhead.  He was outside his house and heard a Dash-8 overhead.  He looked up to look at it and observed a shiny white object directly overhead.  The object moved in a straight line south and it went from directly above him to the southern horizon in seconds.","163":"I was walking around the park with my son ,we were looking at clouds,trees,i was showing him the deference in clouds and the diferenr kinds of seeds each tree makes.  As we come full circle around the park look up at the clouds and happen to notice an object hovering almost over us in the sky.  It was higher then the trees but under the clouds.  It was as hight as you would exspect a helixopter to be and about the same size of one with out the tail propeler.  It rotated about 45 degrees, then it descended slightly, rotated again i could see heat wave coming form under the back of it and it looked as it had a small blue flame like jet purpoltio.  Coming from it that made it illuminate a light blue.  It moved forward about 29ft the started to elelvate until it vanished in the cloud.  After the cloud had past it was gone, just disappeared.  It made no sound at all","164":"Two circular, rim lights blinking and one irregular lower altitude black amorphous My wife and I were out in the back-yard laying on lounge chairs, looking up at a passing plane and discussing what causes contrails, when she pointed out another object in the sky.   It was around 6PM and the sky was completely clear, good light.  This other object was flashing, but not moving, from what we could tell.  It appeared to be circular or slightly oval, with 3 or 4 lights on the outer edges evenly spaced, again, flashing maybe once every couple of seconds (Not sure, didn\u2019t think to time it.)  These lights were very bright, bright to the point that when they were on, the object became somewhat of a bright smear in the sky.  When they were off, you could see faintly that the shape was roughly circular.  The contrail of the plane that had just passed (going north) was still visible.  The blinking object appeared to be at around the same altitude as the contrail, although, I am no pro at determining such a thing. So, what do you do when confronted with something like this?  Well, you look for more like it of course.  We scanned the sky and didn\u2019t see any other similar objects.  However, coming from the north going south and close to us, maybe 1000ft up we saw a moving black object.  It was an irregular shape and it seemed to change shape as it moved which made us wonder if it was some sort of deflating balloon that had been released.  However, it was moving at a pretty steady speed and there really wasn\u2019t much wind.  I don\u2019t know how big this thing was and will leave it at that for now because my gut tells me it was unrelated and probably some normal thing. The first object had moved east while we watched the black thing.  It had to have moved relatively far because it was noticeably smaller.  Then we noticed an object identical to this one coming in from the north, apparently moving in the direction of the first object.  By this time, it looked like the first object had stopped moving again, but I could be wrong about that.  Hard to tell from that distance\/angle.  The similar object was clearly on an intersecting path and soon the two met and then from that point on you couldn\u2019t differentiate between them and they slowly faded out. I can\u2019t say much about the speed of the first object because we didn\u2019t see it move to the other location.  However, the object that \u201ccaught up\u201d with it was moving fast.  We are under a major flight path, see planes passing all the time.  The second object was moving as fast as or faster than the planes we see passing by.  In that moment I thought it was faster, possibly much faster, only because we had just seen a plane pass by and I think memory of that influenced my analysis.  But who knows, really?  At times like that you\u2019re not exactly thinking about making accurate measurements. Of course, I did not have my phone, having left it in my office, but even if I had my phone, I doubt the pictures would have given much because of the altitude of the objects.  For the black object maybe, it would have helped because that was closer, but again, I think that was something likely to have a down to earth explanation. I shared this information with my daughters and they had nothing productive to say, so I gave up on telling anyone else until now.","165":"MADAR Node 152","166":"Observed a strange bright light hovering and then slowly moving in a diagonal pattern across the sky from north to northwest.

It was flying over one of the buildings in my community.  I couldn\u2019t really make out what shape it was because of the lights that it had, but it wasn\u2019t quite round maybe close to a wide rectangle.  The whole bottom of the object was glowing an Amber\/orange color and on the left and the right side each side had one red glowing light.  The way the lights looked was so strange because it was like looking at lights glowing through a fog.  You couldn\u2019t distinctly see the light but it was glowing and you could see the color.  There was no fog or clouds this night it was clear so I thought that was odd.  The object was moving slowly and silently as it moved.  It move north over the building and I started walking very fast because I wanted to get around the building to not loose my line of sight.  I did lose sight for about 5 seconds as I rounded the! corner of the building and in those 5 seconds it was gone.  I remember thinking I wanted to record it, but didn\u2019t want to look away from it because I didn\u2019t want to miss it.  I wanted to keep looking at this because it is something I have never seen before.  This was the first real ufo I have ever seen.

Report It turns out that I have encountered and documented unexplained things in the sky on three separate occasions.  The most recent was enough for me to look back at a video I had taken almost three months earlier and as I was organizing the material a finger twitch led me to the recycle bin where I found a deleted folder with an object that looks very much like what I saw and documented most recently. Starting with the oldest. On July 27, 2016, at 7:11 (time stamp), I saw something unusual out at pyramid Lake NV and took two pictures.  I\u2019m assuming I observed it only for a short time.  It wasn\u2019t until the other day when I was organizing all the unexplained material I have that I restored the deleted pictures taken in 2016.  I had forgotten about it and as with the next sighting I didn\u2019t think that much of it at the time.  How I found them is as bizarre as any of it. On March 31, 2019, at 1:52 PM, I took a video with my phone of an object north of my location in Sun Valley, NV.  Minutes prior to that I was out emptying garbage or something and noticed something in the sky.  It looked like a Mylar balloon that was reflecting the sun in intervals.  Not exact intervals.  I remember thinking that I live in the flight path; debris that high doesn\u2019t seem safe. I  saw my neighbor, brought his attention to it and grabbed my phone.  As my neighbor and I watched it he was saying it was garbage and I thought yah a piece of Mylar but a 4x8 sheet because it looked too far away to be a one foot balloon.  I took several pictures not able to see it in the viewfinder just point and shoot.  With the eyes it would not be visible for moments and then you would see it flash brightly and repeatedly (possibly 2 or 3 different intervals) for a few seconds.  I don\u2019t recall how it ended as far as, I think I got bored and went inside as opposed to it disappeared.  Probably 5 t! o 15 minutes of observation. At the time with my neighbors\u2019 comments and opinion that it was nothing, I wasn\u2019t personally very excited and didn\u2019t download the pictures and video to a desktop until June 7th.  If memory serves I saw nothing on the pictures and deleted them and wasn\u2019t excited enough to render the video in order to capture a still to zoom in on until July 1st.  I became more excited to see what the object in the video looked like when I had a third encounter with an unexplained object in the sky that I observed for probably 40 minutes.  I\u2019ve now crawled over the video and captured quite a few stills from the March 31 video.  One still fortuitously caught a fly passing by and I also captured 5 stills (or snapshots) labeled \u201cmove sequence\u201d showing what appears to be a second object appearing and moving away from the first object very fast as the first object disappears.  The whole event of the second object lasted less than a second! Digital zoom on the video frame doesn\u2019t seem to be as good as wi! th photos but the object looks extremely similar to both encounters at Pyramid despite the fact that to the eye in March it looked defined shining and strobing.  In June of this year and July of 2016 (at Pyramid Lake) the object to the eye looked like a small roundish white cloud. June was wispy and undefined but you could see it all the time, it didn\u2019t move and it looked a different color temperature than the surrounding clouds. Tuesday June 25th 2019 I drove out to Pyramid Lake NV for a swim.  I purchased a day use pass at 4:23 PM and took the (I think 15 minute) drive to Wino beach.  I don\u2019t recall how long I observed the strange object I saw in the sky before I took the first picture at 5:22.  The object I saw to the East of my location looked like a very small cloud but it was a significantly whiter color.  What really made me take notice was that it was not moving with the surrounding clouds. I took 27 pictures and one video never seeing it in the viewfinder over the course of about 17 minutes.  I believe I may have not seen it for a little while, while there was a dense cloud where it was.  I probably \u201cpaid attention\u201d to the object for 40 minutes.  I think I left the beach around 7:00 and recall looking for it, not seeing it and seeing several condensation trails.  I recalled not seeing any sign of aircraft the entire time I was observing the object.","178":"Saw object hovering in sky, disappeared in the clouds at great rate of spped.

They are stationary, last for a few moments, then fade.  The lights appeared one at a time usually, but the final event witnessed involved four lights appearing simultaneously in different directions off the coast.

I live in a pretty rural area so the sky is really clear and easy to see on cloudless nights.  I heard what I thought was a helicopter flying pretty low and I didn't pay attention to it until it more into my line of vision.  I noticed there were three lights and I figured, for a second, it was three flying in formation, BUT I kept watching and the lights stayed completely equidistant the entire time.  I went to our back porch to get a better look and I saw the barest hint of a triangle silhouette.  I watched the lights disappear behind the hills, the lights stayed totally equidistant and did not change (not at all like the brigades of helicopters I've seen flying together, even at night).

One by one they slowly circled back south and blacked out.

My brother and I were driving from Philipsburg, PA, to State College, PA, on Rte. 322 South, when I noticed a kite- or diamond-shaped formation of 5 or 6 bright orange balls of light flying in the sky above our car!  I was astounded and asked my brother, \u201cWhat was that?!\u201d  He didn\u2019t know.   So, I drove up the hill a little bit farther and turned into the Moshannon Valley Regional Business Center.  I went to the back of the parking lot where it was a little darker, and we could see the entire vista of the valley facing west and northwest.  We had lost sight of the kite-shaped formation,  but we were amazed as one bright orange ball of light after another appeared out of the setting sun, came due east straight toward our car, banked to the left and rose simultaneously to another altitude.  As they did this, one after another, their lights went completely out and they disappeared.  I did happen to catch the silhouette of one after it went \u201clights out\u201d, and it was shaped sort of like a big, thick war plane with wings back like a jet.  But, these were not planes \u2013 there were no flashing lights like planes have (they were just bright balls of orange lights \u2013 almost like someone setting off fireworks that flew horizontally through the air \u2013 and then they each banked to the left, rose up and went black). I noticed that someone else reported the exact same thing on 07\/17\/19 in Altoona, PA, which is about 45 miles southwest of State College, PA where we live.  Here is the experience that they reported:  Bright orange big light quiet, appeared to the south moved across the sky & got dimmer then dissipated, repeated 5 times over 1\/2 hour. I saw an orange light pretty bright & big sort of just appeared at a point south of my house moved across the sky towards the north, after a couple minutes kept getting less bright then sort of dissipated, no sound at all.  At first I thought it was a big plane or a drone, but then another appeared at the same spot and moved across the sky and again after a few minutes it got weaker and dissipated around the same area to the north like the other one had. I got my wife out of the house and she watched it happen 3 more times with me, we both were confused at what we were seeing.  This happened 5 times over about 30 minutes then it stopped. Can someone PLEASE help me and tell me that we did NOT see a UFO in the night sky last night?!?","197":"Perfect triangle, est 15x15x15, 6 or so lights on each town in night time. This was seen from at least a half mile away, while driving on interstate 540 from bellavista going into Bentonville.  I pointed it to my kids thinking it was a blimp with massive lights on the bottom...  strange though as the formed a perfect triangle.  The lights on the bottom were set on straight rows at least 15 foot by 15 foot by 15 foot.  These lights were all white, and on each row there were at least 5 or 6 lights that were clearly individual lights.  My kid attempted pictures while I was driving but the first was black and second was blurry.  I suspect possible military craft but doesn\u2019t make sense due to perfect shape would not be condusive to long distance travel.  As we approached closer the craft began to move after being completely stationary for 2 minutes and crossed the interstate and headed toward bella vista fairly quickly.  Thinking military or private owned..  so large maybe someone built there own thing and was riding on it?  We confined! on our trip toward Fayetteville.  4 witnesses...  kids suggested a little haze when it moved.  Definitely clear no haze when stationary.

It had a slight bobbing motion and side to side zip, this was very slight. I thought it was an aircraft and couldn\u2019t understand why a plane did not move ima trajectory in the sky.  I watched it for what I believe was an hour and then it was gone.  It had three lights in a line parallel to the ground.  This is my first sighting of a craft that I couldn\u2019t decipher.","199":"Late night with my sunroof open facing south I have been watching skies since the 2014 sighting over Crystal Lake, IL.  This was 2 singular bright lights shining downward\/outward close together but apart traveling at a high speed (faster than our regular airforce jets)  and they did not have any wing or tail red lights flashing  or the usual military lighting that has been the norm over northern ILLINOIS.  These were 2 very bright white lights traveling from Southeast to Northwest with each light brighter than the stars or regular aircraft.... I know this clearly.  Nothing like these came overhead before.  Larger bright lights. 20-30 secs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))","200":"Two faint circular orange objects flying in straight line covered approx. 1\/4 of night sky within several seconds. Two faint orange objects appearing to be of circular shape flew approx north to south in stright lines beside each other, one slighly following behind, across 1\/4 of the sky within several seconds (5-10 sec.).  They were observed between two roofs in suburban area, emerged from behind one house roof, flew straight, then flew behind other house roof.  The distance was approx. 1\/4 of nigh sky.  No sound was heared.","201":"Bright white star darting around between 150-160 degrees S-SE before ascending away towards the Aquila constellation. I had just backed our car into our parking spot. Although it was a crystal clear night, there was a lot of light pollution and only a few bright stars were visible. My husband got out of the car to walk to the mailboxes. I took the moment to look up at the sky and appreciate the view from our convertible before closing the roof. While looking up westward at the sky, I saw a very bright white \u2018star\u2019 move across the sky SE to S (about 5-6\u201d) in my peripheral vision. There were no other visible stars in its vicinity, nor were there any aircraft. I slowly got out of the car without taking my eyes off the \u2018star\u2019 and turned to look up at it directly in its very high south position. It continued to move in random directions, not varying much between 160 degrees S and 150 degrees SE . I called for my husband to come over quickly, I pointed out the \u2018star\u2019 and asked him if he could see it moving, too. He said yes, and we stood watching the star dart around for about five minutes. Then we laid down on the sidewalk to stabilize ourselves to be sure it was the \u2018star\u2019 that was moving and not our bodies. We continued to watch it dart around for another 10 minutes or so. Although it did not waiver in its brightness until it seemed to move away, my husband also observed periodic white lights to the sides of the star. I did not see this detail. We didn\u2019t try to take any photos or videos because we only had our iPhones with us. The movement seemed to start to slow down and the star seemed to move out further at 154 SE degrees towards the Aquila constellation. We got up and walked to our house and encountered our neighbors. We pointed out the moving star and they could both see it and its movements but it was getting harder for any of us to make it out. At 11:21 pm we went inside as the star was now too far away to discern from the light pollution. This morning, a knowledgeable friend did a quick check on a satellite tracking app for the evening of the 26th and the brightest thing during the time frame I cited was an ISS pass (a very bright magnitude -1.1), but that was at the opposite side of the sky and skirting the northern horizon from our area's vantage point.  The only satellite transiting Aquila at the time was a GPS sat on a polar orbit, which are very faint.","202":"Large bright orb with smaller orb following behind it. It was around 11:18PM, and my friends and I were hanging out outside when I see an orb appear out of nowhere in the west.  At first I thought it was Arcturus, but it got brighter and was moving towards me.  (I love astronomy, and am always looking up when I'm outside.) It was a bright light yellowish color, not blinking and no noise.  It was flying as close to us as a lower flying airplane, so I thought maybe it was a drone.   As it headed east and passed above us, we noticed there was a smaller orb following at the same speed behind it probably as far back as a plane's length or a little more.  It looked like the smaller orb was following it or being \u201ctowed.\u201d  Again, no noise or blinking lights.  There was no deviation in its brightness.  I was able to grab a video on my phone but it only captured the larger or the two.  It kept moving east at the same speed, and we watched as it continued out of view.","203":"Fast moving large rectangle craft flying North to South over Sacramento, CA, in the night sky On the evening of Friday, July 26th, 2019, I was out in my side yard just South of Sacramento California.  It was close to midnight and dark, with normal light pollution for my area.  I was facing North when I saw above me in my peripheral vision something moving fast in my direction.  I looked up and saw a very large rectangle moving very fast approximately North to South over Sacramento and it continued its course until I could no longer see it in the distance (was still heading South). It crossed almost directly over my head at what seemed to be above a normal airplane altitude but spanned the distance of the entire sky in approximately 8 seconds from the time I first saw it.  I don\u2019t know how fast that is but it made the F-22 Raptor I\u2019ve seen near Fresno seem sluggish, cumbersome, and awkward flying in comparison.  It traveled effortlessly, was a light color, possibly silver or a light grey\u2014I could see it in the dark but it had no lights on at all\u2014and it also made no sound.  The rectangle was approximately the shape of a stick of gum.  I\u2019d guess about a 3 to 1 ratio with no other form to it and it went forward in width rather than length wise. I wish I knew more but I only had enough time to think I would Google it to find out what it was.  In doing so I found no explanations for what it could be besides a UFO.  I was elated after seeing this, it was a pretty wonderful sight.    The only thing I can think is Beale Air Force Base up North but again I found no satisfying information on the internet.","204":"Bright white light crossing from Southeast to Northwest fast and Bright\/large.... faster than airforce jets that are normally crossing overhead.  Again it was singular bright light.  Not an airplane or jet or small\/tiny slow satellite.  It's an abnormal nonairplane bright white light.","205":"In the early morning hours of July 27th, 2019.  I witnessed between 3 and 6 lights that moved consistantly accross the sky as if they were Satellites.  These lights would appear moments after visually seeing what appeared to be a shooting star which each appeared to me to be leaving the orbit as opposed to entering it.  When following each of these lights from one side to the other, there would then be a shooting star at a 45 degree angle outward that would happen.  This same thing happened 3 clear times.  There were other high flying US planes to compare speed, trajectory etc. as well.  Locater in the PNW, I was facing westerly centering myself with a bright star I later determined to be Zenith.  The more complex part is that while trying to telepathically communicate with this star, when showing emotion the object were responding to my feeble attemps at communication.  I dont drink or use drugs.  I was sober.  I absolutely believe we all should be looking up.  Not just for a moment or two.  But spend and hour go sit under the stars.  Let your eyes adjust. You CAN communicate with it all if you let it happen.  This is also the first of any such article I have ever written on this or any similar subject.  I believed enough to find this page and offer my contribution.  I now believe.  I will be back out tonight and each night!

The lights appeared one by one, hardly moved or moved very slowly, then dissipated one by one into thin air.  We saw it from our balcony at our apartment and the lights were over the Ashley River (peninsula) in Charleston, SC.   It was a clear sky for the most part, it was dark. we had no lights on or anything in the house or on the balcony.   It was just me and my husband.","209":"While looking for shooting stars with my fiance, I was looking at a triangle constellation that I always look at.  There was a star next to it that was not moving for around 30 seconds.  Then it began to move to the left in a straight line slowly.  It just looked like a moving star.  But then it broke from the straight path and altered its course too quick for an airplane.  It continued in a straight line for a few minutes, moving very slow but steady.  It went across the entire sky and when it was between 2 stars it stopped.  It held its position for 2-3 minutes.  During this time I was telling at my fiance that it stopped.   Then it slowly dimmed out, twice.  Each time slowly lighting back up. Then it changed course again as it began to drop straight down below the horizon.  It dimmed out and disappeared twice more.  Each time it would dim out it would slowly reappear in the same spot it had disappeared.  Like it stopped moving to disappear and continued dropping again! once it lit up again.  Then it fell below the tree line and disappeared for good.  I watched that area of the sky for a few minutes and then I watched a shooting star shoot from the right of the object away from me.  The shooting star was low on the horizon, which was odd.  This was not a plane nor helicopter as it was too high up, moved too slow, had no flashing lights, and stayed stationary for minutes.  My fiance also witnessed this and admits it was not explainable.  I've never seen a UFO until this.  And it seemed to disguise itself as a star.  When it first began there was an airplane in the sky, way far away from this object.","210":"Light moves straight up Sitting at campfire sky clear, seen a bright light go upward in sky then move across and disappear.","211":"3 long bright orange objects seen by 2 people in Gurnee IL My husband and I were sitting outside, enjoying a summer evening.  Something caught his eye, he looked up, and screamed for me to look.  We both looked and saw 3 extremely bright orange objects in the sky.  They were long and not too large.  He yelled for me to take a picture.  I always have my cell phone with me so I took 3 pictures.  Then he said, no, take a video.  I switched to video mode but at that point the objects started moving quickly.  We starting running from the back of our house to the front, but the objects moved quickly together and then out of sight.","212":"2 parallel lights heading NW to SE toward MacDill AFB. 2 lights in parallel formation.  Came from north west to south east from over Indian Rocks Beach overhead.  Shivered and shot away.","213":"2 objects spotted  in a VERY rural area of NH We saw what looked like a star at first that moved across the sky - it wasn't a shooting star or meteor.  When it moved, it went in sort of a wavey like motion.  At this point I still really didn't think much of it but then someone else there noticed a second one, and that's where I diverted my attention.  The first \"star\" was moving towards the second one, which was coming down at that moment towards the horizon.  I had my eye on it then the light just went out.  It was a crazy.  I also want to make it clear that I don't know if it were \"aliens\" or not, but I would never lie about such a thing like seeing a UFO.","214":"multiple unconnected drone scale lights appeared at short distance and then within 10 yards of me then moved away While walking on dark moonless night I noticed flashes of light up near some oak trees may be 50 yards away and thought it was a drone at first but another source of light pulled my attention to about 10 yards in front of me near some cattails in the is little marshy area-  Again I thought drone but the lights were not connected and flashed, faded and then sped away back up towards where I saw the first flashes.  I thought well maybe it was kids with lasers pointers but the angles and lights didn\u2019t move like that.  My music had stopped playing and I was  a little freaked felt like the lights had run off and away from me, so I wasn\u2019t in a panic but alert for sure.

I definitely saw it clear as day. I have perfect eye sight and am not under the influence of drugs or alcohol where I thought I saw something that didn't really exist.

It was a large orange orb in the sky.  It was moving rather slowly and eventually came to a stop for a moment and then continued its course in the sky.  Eventually, I lost sight of it. At first I thought a plane was on fire?  But it was very clearly a bright orange bubble of light that appeared to have two smaller and sharper lights towards the bottom of it.

After about 7 minutes from the time I spotted the red light travelling from left to right, I saw the second witness and pointed out the UFO to him.  I asked him what it might be.  We watched it for about 2 minutes. About 9 minutes from the time I spotted it, drops of white and red alternating light fell off of the bright, red light.

On July 29th, 2019, a friend and I were sitting on a blanket on the lawn of a B & B in the little town of Powell River, British Columbia.  The B & B is a block from Marine Avenue, which runs along the sea coast.  My friend since high school is a web designer and entrepreneur; I am a working musician.  We are both 51 years old.  The previous night had been clear and the stars bright, and I had witnessed a spectacular shooting star.  I was hoping for a repeat, but we were disappointed by the intermittent cloud cover and slight haziness in the air on this night.  The clouds were drifting very slowly to the East.  There was no moon and the night was still and silent. Some time between 1:10 am and 1:13 am--now the morning of the 30th--my friend nudged my shoulder, and directed my attention to the sky. Clearing the treetops, a strange light formation glided silently into view, traveling in a straight line from East to West, towards the ocean and directly over our heads.  I felt there was no time to fiddle with my phone--and I doubted it would capture the object anyway -- so I left it where it lay and leapt to my feet to better view the formation. The formation was shaped like a boomerang bent at about a 150 degree angle, with its elbow pointed in the direction of travel.  It consisted of between five and ten white lights (unfortunately, neither one of us counted the number).  The glow of the lights had a gentle, self-contained quality that reminded me of bio-luminescence.  They were not as bright as aircraft lights or stars, and were larger--more like orbs than pin-pricks.  The rigidity of the formation suggested a structure behind it, but I could not see any fuselage or wings. My friend does not need corrective lenses for distance, and so may have been able to perceive a bit more detail than I.  She said afterwards that she thought the lights were slightly oval.  She had been reminded of balloons trailing strings, and then she had thought of jelly fish.  I did not perceive these \"strings\", however, as I focused on an individual light, I clearly saw it slide, with a slight arc, a few degrees out ahead of the other, then slide back into it's original position.  I say \"slide\", because the motion did not seem aerodynamic or bird-like, nor wobbly and wind-blown, but rather fluid -- even fish-like.  My friend mentioned a \"pulsing\" of the lights, and I suspect this was her perception of the motion I was seeing. The following point may sound contradictory, but I want to be clear: while I saw this light move relative to the other, the entire formation as a whole was rigid.  If the lights were beads on a string, the string neither lengthened, nor shortened.  The angle of the \"boomerang\" did not change; the two halves of the \"boomerang\" did not flex or wobble.  It did not veer, sway, or stretch out and reform such as a formation of birds will do (I've seen countless Canadian geese formations flying over my home in BC, and this was not that). It was not a string of Mylar balloons drifting on a breeze:  it was traveling too fast and straight, in a direction opposite to that of the slowly moving clouds, and in a manner that was -- as my friend insisted I mention -- \"intentional\".  I completely agree with her on this point. The formation\/object? crossed the the visible sky--an opening in the trees of perhaps 130 feet across--in about 15 seconds.  My impression was not one of extreme speed, but something like that of an aircraft.  It was well below the clouds, and given that I could discern the lights as orbs as opposed to pin-pricks, and also discern movement of the lights, I feel I was seeing it relatively close-up.  Our hands outstretched above our heads and held 18 to 24 inches apart, would have framed it.  I estimate it was perhaps 60 feet across, and not more than a few hundred feet above us.  It's possible it was a larger object farther away, but these are my impressions.  It was absolutely silent the whole time.","263":"As I was laying in bed looking through the window I saw a colorful flashing hovering  light (blueish green, red and white) .  I woke my wife up so she didn't think I was nuts if I told her in the morning.  As we both got out of bed and watched this object hovering and moving quickly side to side and up and down just over our treeline but what seemed to be in quite the distance.  I took video of this and my camera really picked up the white light flashing.   After taking the video we proceeded to grab our binoculars and that confirmed that it was an unidentified flying object that was circular in shape and the lights were alternating as if it was spinning. The object then went below the treeline and disappeared word of a lie.","264":"Very bright lights in the sky that hovered in place for over an hour Woke up at 3 a.m., and decided to go downstairs.  I rolled over, put my glasses on, and I saw bright lights that I thought was a plane.  I thought it was odd to see a plane on the flight path to Logan Airport at that hour.   Then I realized the lights were not moving, and noticed the lights were sort of shimmering and blinking (mostly white with what appeared to be only one red light).  I kept staring at it thinking maybe it was a planet or a star, but this was no planet or star since I could see individual lights.  It seemed to be moving to the left then to the right only a tiny bit, and seemed to be rotating.  Then to the left of it, there was a very, very bright flash that lasted for less than a second.  Then the same thing happened to the right of it.   Laid there still awake for about a half hour, then looked out the window again. It was still there--not moving, but blinking and shimmering.  Around 4:45, it was further away. The flashes were more like thin beams of extremely bright white light that travelled in perfectly straight vertical lines.  They appeared in a flash, in a nanosecond\u2014and these flashes were blinding.  I cannot imagine I was the only person who saw this.","265":"Very Bright Lights in the Sky Near Middleboro, MA Woke up at 3 a.m. and when I looked out my bedroom window, I saw what I thought was an airplane.  When I realized it was not moving, I stared at it for a time to try to determine what it was.  The object was distant, but not so distant that I could not see a little detail.  It had bright lights, seemed to be pulsating, and moved almost imperceptibly from left to right.  The lights appeared to be in a triangular shape.  At one point, an extremely bright, perfectly vertical, thin beam of light appeared next to it (think of a flashbulb, but quicker).  This happened twice.  This thing remained in the sky, in the same spot, for over an hour.","266":"Second time this week I was awoken from a sound sleep by eerie rythmatic pulsating like sound that seemed to be coming from outside up in the sky.

As I first came to the stop sign, I noticed an extremely bright metallic looking sphere in the sky that flew across at speeds much faster than the speed of any aircraft or missile that I have ever seen or heard of.  Its height was around 2,000 to 4,000 feet above ground and from checking 2k quality surveillance footage of our property camera that faced to the West.  I determined that the object did not come from behind me and perhaps from above me.  It flew to the East which was the direction I was facing at that high speed and then after nearing the 15 freeway a few miles out it began to dive at a forty-five degree angle at half of its previous speed until it was a thousand feet or less above ground and it nearly came to a full stop just outside of our view in which a large building was in the way of our line of sight.  As we drove past the building to get a better view, it flew away travelling at its top speed in the South-East direction.  The object was by far the brightest object in the sky shining a white\/grey absolute metallic looking shine as if it was reflecting the sun.  At that time of day, the sun has just set behind the nearby mountains and was hardly visible at all.  The sky was mostly clear and there was still near full daylight outside.  As the IT tech for the large facility in which I work at here, I went back and searched all of the surveillance footage from dozens of high definition cameras, but sadly all except for one camera was aimed high enough to view at the sky which was the North-West facing camera which is the one I used to see if the object came from behind my location.  My roommate who was a Marine and I have never seen anything like that object online or from any other media source.  I can only wish that one of our cameras had caught that occurrence, the object was so vivid an! d pronounced that it would have spoken for itself on video as it was the brightest object I have ever seen in the sky other than the sun itself.  What is also interesting is that this occurred one day after the night a double meteor storm (Southern delta Aquariids\/alpha Capricornids) was to be the most active.  This object did not act in any manner of a meteor, it was very low flying, greatly reduced speed, was visible for a large number of seconds and was undeniably metallic.","272":"Quiet, low flying black circular craft that literally inched across my house. My wife and I were outside on our porch.  She started yelling for me to look up and when I did, I observed this large, black, circular craft with two large bars under it, inching about a thousand feet max in the air.  It was going from west to east and looked as if it was getting lower.  There was no sound coming from craft.  No humming, fumes, turbine sounds, or other noise came from craft.  We observed for about a minute, trying to record videos, but neither of our phones would record.  My kept saying error, hers would not focus at all. We watched until it went behind the tree line.  I ran inside and out the back door to get a closer look. With an airport less than 1\/4 mile away, I jumped in truck and went to see if it landed.  There were no planes on the landing strip nor anything relative in characteristics to what we witnessed.","273":"More lights were turned on once acknowledged before it turned at a steep angle and the lights slowly disappeared My sister and I were both sitting outside on our porch just relaxing for about 10 minutes.  She had started to head inside when I see her stop and start staring at what I thought was a tree when she asked, \u201cDo you see that?\u201d  The whole time we had been outside there had been the sound of a plane, so I thought she may have just saw the the navigation lights of the before stated planes. I had brushed it off in the beginning and then she said, \u201cNo really what is that?\u201d  I lift my head to see one bright orange light over our junk pile about 100 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground that\u2019s when I decide to stand up to get a better look.  After I get to my feet I see about 5 burning orange light in a diagonal formation. Right away, I knew what it was. This wasn\u2019t the first time that I seen one around the area.  On the way home from a family event me and 5 others saw the same similar orange circular lights.  At first it was hard to see but then it sent a large beam of orange light onto the field lighting the whole five acres and revealing the the bulging hole and the rest of the aircraft.  The light lasted 5 seconds and we were so shaken up we pulled over in a nearby business and got out to look to see were it had went.  We were surprised to see a extremely long rectangular shape that was thin at the end and thicker in the middle with lights every 50 feet.  This thing was over 500 feet long. Following this large shape were 30 smaller lights formation flying and they would shift places every now and again.  That experience had lasted over two minutes before two planes with navigation lights went moving at a high rate speed towards the moving lights.  That was the first time we had heard any noise of a plane.  After that slowly all of the lights blinked out and were only left with the two pairs of navigation lights which seem like they were in pursuit. With that experience in mind I tell my sister that I believe we were looking at a UFO.  As soon as I say this either the craft turned on more lights or changed direction and there are twenty on these ominous orange lights at a forty five degree angle slowly moving up.  In shock my eyes could not move off the craft.  There was a slight height change before one by one the lights disappeared and there was no further evidence of anything being there. When we open the door both dogs were waiting with a bleak stare, as if something had happened and were fine once interacted with. No one else in the house had noticed a difference, but acknowledged that it occurred more than most would believe.","274":"Eastern cloud covered sky saw 3 orange orbs, 1 was larger, 2 smaller were chasing each other around eventually converging into 1 then vanished.","275":"Bright star-like object moves slowly across sky and hovers for a minute before disappearing and reappearing Shortly after 10PM, my son and I witnessed what we believe to be a UFO.  I was putting my 8 year old to bed when we noticed lightning outside his window.  So we sat by the open window for a moment and admired the sky in the distance while listening to the thunder.   A minute or so went by when I noticed out of the corner of my eye, a bright star-like object moving across the sky.  There were no blinking lights so I jokingly told my son it was a UFO.  He looked over and the object stopped before our eyes and was hovering!!  It was almost like you could see it slightly moving, but it stayed in the same spot.  We gave each other this look like, are we really seeing what we think we are?!   He then looked back out the window and the light disappeared before his eyes.  I double checked to also see if it was gone, and it was but then it reappeared one more time for a few seconds then vanished again before our eyes.  Afterward, we both sat there stunned for a moment and tried p! iecing together what just happened.  The logical explanation is \u201cweather balloon\/satellite.\u201d  But my gut is telling me something different.  Obviously, I\u2019m not the only one to witness such occurrences, and this isn\u2019t my first time questioning what I\u2019ve seen. I just hope whatever it is, it\u2019s peaceful and just curious!","276":"Orange orbs over the ocean at night, every 20-25 min, some grouped and some individual My wife and I were stargazing near the water on a clear night.  There was light cloud cover and a storm very far out to sea. Our first sighting was what appeared to be 5 orange lights, all in a row parallel to the horizon, slipping from behind a cloud, moving out and around the cloud, then moving back into the cloud and fading.  This occurred in the skies south of our position.  Total visible time was about 10-12 seconds. These objects were circular, with a slight twinkle to them.  The hue was definitely a bright orange, almost yellow toward the middle when they were at their brightest. Throughout the night we saw several single flashes of orange light.  The flashes were primarily located in the south eastern sky and only lasted a moment.  They resembled jet engines, but we heard no sounds that might indicate military aircraft. Our second sighting, coming just before returning to our house, was of a long string of orbs that seemed to extend\/\u201ccome from\u201d a single orb that appeared\/\u201cturned on\u201d first and began to move slowly.  The orbs moved in unison and were bright enough that the orange light they gave off reflected on the ocean surface.  Again, they faded into clouds and were gone.  Total visible time was again about 10-12 seconds.","277":"My wife, son, daughter in law, and I were all sitting on the beach getting ready to look for shooting stars when we all saw four (4) orange lights in a tight formation - forming a straight line.  A few seconds later, another identical formation of 4 lights appeared to the right, maybe 15 degrees apart from the first one.  Both formations disappeared at exactly the same time after only a few seconds.  We later determined that we were facing due south at the time.","278":"Disappearing and flashing lights maneuvering and changing speed periodically Three circle shaped lights maneuvered across the sky, going straight slowing down than speeding up every 3 or so seconds, the lights would also periodically disappear and reaper with a flash of light as if they were cloaking and un-cloaking.","279":"Parallel series of two orange dots, 4 pairs of 2. Tonight, sitting on the beach at Folly Beach South Carolina, myself, my wife, and my son-in-law observed what we can only term as a UFO.  Or rather a series of UFO\u2018 S.   It was approximately 10:30 PM Eastern time on 7\/30\/2019, when I pointed out to my wife that were some points of orange light appearing and then disappearing out over the ocean.  Note: at Folly Beach we are facing south as opposed to east on most of the east coast of the USA.  We assumed those were airliners although the color was very different than anything I have seen in the past, however that could be explained by cloud cover or any number of things.   My wife went inside and my son and I were talking, when I suddenly shouted out what the heck is that?  He turned around and saw the tail end of what I was seeing, but what I had seen was a series of orange dots in pairs descending towards the ocean from our vantage point at a 45\u00b0 angle from the South by South East sky.  We talked about it for a minut! e and just decided that we didn\u2019t know what it was.  My wife came back outside, we told her what we had seen, and kind of laughed it off.   After a few minutes, though, all three of us saw another series of pairs of orange lights progressing south to north in front of us.  Our son also saw another series of lights coming west to east, although considerably south of us.  My wife and I were aware of those other lights but we were focused on the ones directly in front of us, straight to the south. These were very straight line events, there were no orange shapes fluttering around in the air. They came as two dots, Then within a second two more dots,  And then again and again until there were four sets of dots on two parallel lines pointing roughly in our direction.  Then they were gone, quickly disappearing.  The lights off to the east also behaved in the same fashion and disappeared almost in the same second. OK, I am an engineer, my wife is an artist, and my son-in-law is an IT specialist.  We don\u2019t actually see the world in the same way, but we saw this exactly the same.  And none of the three of us can explain what we saw.  My wife and I lived under a flight pattern for midway airport in Chicago, and sitting out at night we used to see airliners flying over all the time.  I have never seen a series of dots, appearing in the sky that far away in a sudden sequence, where in the space of a second that had to be hundreds of miles apart, straight, parallel, and in a consistent pattern.   An hour later we are still sitting out here, unable to go to bed, because we cannot begin to understand what we saw.  I suppose we will sit out here most of the night waiting for something more to show, and nothing will come.  But we will know that we have seen something that cannot be explained by relatively sophisticated people.","280":"Flashes in clear night sky.

Turned away for a second, other 3 witnesses started saying \"what is that\".  Look again toward Jupiter.  (unit for distance I will use the width of thumbnail at arm's length).  About 1 unit left (east) of Jupiter and 2 or 3 below, two bright lights had now appeared, one exactly over the other.  Spacing between the two lights was one unit or very close.  Brightness of each was not quite as bright as Jupiter, or brighter than the few stars around Jupiter.  Motion, barely detectable, but I felt they were moving north.  The top one dimmed out in about 3 to 4 seconds, and then the bottom one dimmed out in the same amount of time.  Checked phone app, could not find any satellites to match this close pair.  Found some that were about a minute and a half ap! art on the app I have, but nothing found being that close together.  One witness perceived their height to be lower than jet liner altitudes.  I could not tell.  My perception of their speed, after spotting satellites for years, is that they were moving far slower than the usual satellites I see.  We did see the ISS at 22:25 hours as well.","297":"Bright light Large bright circle light in the sky just below the Big Dipper.  We watched it go across the sky north then it curved south.  No clouds in the sky and it was brighter than the plane flying that was flying west of it.  We watched it for a few mins then it vanished.  There was no flashing lights like the plane and a lot brighter.","298":"4th time seeing this same object witnessed this for first time last year This is the 4th time seeing this same light but this time it was moving west heading east moving steady pace no blinking lights just a very bright light like a star same exact object we've seen go straight up before disappearing.","299":"Diamond shape with swinging projection underneath, flashing lights and sporadic movement The object seamed to have a diamond shape with a projection on the bottom that seemed to sway.  It move  sporadically and the project had at least two lights that flashed every few seconds.  It  seem to stop, and hover in one place, before lowering behind the treelike.  As it was receding, I managed to look at it in a telescope and it was bright enough to make out the diamond shape and projection with lights.  Once it stopped moving sporadically, the swing of the projection stopped as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It appeared to be two spheres methodically rotating around a center axis or one sphere orbiting one in the center. The objects stayed the same distance from each other the entire time I witnessed them and if I had to guess I would say there was about the spacing of half of one sphere between the two.  They were fairly close together. I am certain there were 2 objects.  The rotation was fairly rapid, maybe 20 cycles a minutes and the speed seemed very consistent.  The objects were to my north, and seemed very high up in the sky.  I am unsure the size, as I had nothing to reference them against.  The sky was clear and cloudless. I stopped and watched these objects for approximately 15 minutes.  I pointed them out to several of the other guys on site who saw them but didn't take as much interest in them as me.  One said there had been a person flying a drone at the park the previous day, but that it had been black.  These objects were white. I looked away for approximately 3 or 4 minutes to do something and when I looked for it again it was gone.  I did not see the manner that it left in. I don't believe it was a drone. If it was it was not a design I have ever seen. After the fact I did some googling and see the local collage in St. Peter has a summer program where they launch high altitude balloons. https:\/\/gustavus.edu\/camps\/ballooning\/  The balloon in the first picture on that website looks like the color of the spheres.  The dates listed are not when I observed this object. I cannot find any pictures online of two balloons being tied to one payload. I have reached out to 3 people at Gustavus for comment and have not yet got any replies. I also have seen news reports of testing of high altitude reconnaissance balloons being tested over the midwest, including Minnesota.  I have not seen any pictures of these and don't know how to account for the methodical spinning or how it departed in 3 minutes after not appearing to move for 15 minutes. I would appreciate any thoughts, comments or questions.","305":"On checking my window surveillance camera, I saw a flash that looks like lightening and then a fast moving ball of light moves across the top of the cameras view.

My wife and I was going home from South Haven.  I looked to my right and saw a circle shaped shadow in a field near.  There was no clouds or anything to make such a pattern .  I looked around and seen that the field was bare and no structures or trees was within 300 yards from the sight .  I looked and it appeared to be nothing but a open field with nothing near the location.  I was lost in thought and returned today at 10:00 am and walked over the sight before trying to report it.  There was just a outline of one craft  that appeared to be invisible but not able to block the sunlight and appears to show its form on the ground . There was no aircraft in the vicinity.  Later a military helicopter was in the vicinity as well as a convoy of military trucks .  the helicopter flew low and was very loud.","307":"Two objects hovering and traveling at great rate of speed. August 1, 2019.  Northwest of Decatur, Texas:  Between 19:30 and 20:00, I was outside watering my plants and trees.  It was a clear night and I observed two objects fairly close in the Western Sky.  They were hovering on top of the other one and seem to stay in the same position for a few minutes.  I continued to watch them and they took off into the southeastern sky at a great rate of speed.  They circled around and came back past my location at a greater rate of speed and disappeared in the north sky.  They both appeared to have several lights in front of the crafts.","308":"I saw something strange white light in sky that closed like a television...it was very bright as I am looking at a star which is too near...and in a second it closed which resemble the view when we switch off a TV...the light just shut down like it went too far in a second.

The object was emitting a bright white light and was ascending vertically.  There where no other indicator lights on the craft.  After five minutes the object rapidly accelerated vertically.  Within 30 seconds it was gone.","311":"Bright light moving very slowly across the sky suddenly seems to dissapear while quickly accelerating The smoke from neighboring fires finally ceased direction and I was looking to the skies to point out satellites to a friend. While my friend went inside I noticed a very bright slow moving light,  I began to test if my phone camera would pick it up; it did. After filming 12 seconds, I stopped the recording and refocused on the object with my eyes. Within 5 seconds the light almost appeared to stop living then shrank in both size and light intensity before vanishing completely. I observe aircraft and satellites daily and this is unlike anything I've seen first hand.","312":"Disk shaped, four lights, moving in a circular motion, easy to see, soundless. Spotted in a rural area, disappeared as soon as cameras The object was disk\/saucer shaped, had four lights, and was moving in a circular motion.  It seemed to be abnormally close to the ground until we got closer to it and it began to drift further away from us.  The object's color was unknown, yet it was aware that we were watching it.  The object, which was spotted in a rural area was completely soundness.  My friends and I, who are all teenagers, spotted this object around 10pm at night when we were driving home from a night out.  Never seeing anything like this, we were absolutely terrified.  After arriving home, we went outside to see if we could spot the object again, we could see it from a very far distance, but noticed other airplanes which seemed to be chasing the object.","313":"Series of bright orange lights appearing above San Diego Several bright lights above the horizon, right above the cloud layer, bright orange and shimmering.  First, there was one, which we thought might be a light.  Looking from the Poway area, it was Southwest and at the same star location as the Menkent star cluster. It faded away without moving after 5 minutes, but then reappeared in the same spot with a second light around a minute later.  These stuck around for another 5 minutes, or so, faded, and then reappeared with 3 lights, in the same spot. The three lights stayed for about 10 minutes.  During this time, they shimmered in different patterns, then faded away.  After less than a minute, one appeared above and to the right of the original location, stayed a minute, then faded, and soon after two appeared, below the previous but above the original location.  They faded as well, and that was it. There was a heavy Marine layer at the time, so no other stars were shining through, but these were abnormally bright, much brighter than the city lights in the distance though appearing to be just as far.","314":"Bright red cigar shape object slowly moved over Palomar Mt at 10:31pm on Aug 1, 2019.

I watched it pulse for a while when I noticed two smaller blinking red lights.  It stayed hovering over my garage for a few minutes, then suddenly took off over my house and into the distance.  When it flew over my house, it made a sound similar to a low-flying plane, but it was very much not a plane.","316":"Triangle shape object while driving on 380 south towards gouldsboro exit was moving slow definitely not a plane.  2 lights at rear facing down and 1 in front object seemed to have a triangle illumination to it.  Only wish I could have taken picture of object.","317":"Saw multiple aircrafts, a bright white light and smaller red lights. Started out by just seeing a bright yellow\/white light in the sky just sitting still for a while - definitely wasn't a star.  Kept looking at it for around 5 min and some dimmer red lights (like speckles) brighten up all around the bright light.  My eyes were locked on to it and I see air crafts fly above the trees.  Their shape were four \"donuts\" arranged with one on the top\/bottom and one each on the side;  Think like the body arrangement of a butterfly with one \"donut\" for its head, tail and wings.  They zoomed by incredibly quickly and that was the last I saw of them.  The bright light slowly moved out of view over the course of 25 min.","318":"White light (UFO) travelled across the sky then disappeared... White light (appear to have some shape ie.  Not a ball) this object\/UFO was high in the sky coming from West heading towards the East.  It was traveling fast but not as fast as say a comet or shooting star.

Looking straight up, I saw a bright blueish\/white light towards the southwest sky that seemed rather far away, possibly even outside the atmosphere.  It appeared out of nowhere and traveled in a straight line for about half a second before making an S-pattern and disappearing.  It was traveling at high speed similar to that of a meteor.  Had it not been for the S-pattern I would have thought it were another meteor.","321":"I saw a \u201cfireball\u201d  brightening and dimming above the Boise foothills followed, by a shooting star above it in the sky Around 3:40am I was standing on my porch and out of the corner of my eye I saw a flash of orange light over the tree line coinciding with the Boise foothills.  For a moment I though it was a lighthouse just by how bright it was, obviously that\u2019s impossible, it just gives you an idea of how forcefully bright this light was.  It resembled a ball of bright fire in one stationary place.  When I finally realized how strange it was and ruled out any other type of craft or car headlights, I kept staring and saw a very bright fire-like object light up after about 10 seconds of staring, it occured in the same place over what would be the Boise foothills.  It looked exactly like a flame except that it became very bright then dimmed until it disappeared.  Between its appearance and its disappearance during the sighting that I directly saw, I\u2019d say it appeared for probably 3-4 seconds before dimming and completely disappearing.  The strange thing is (as if that wasn\u2019t strange! enough) a shooting star occured directly after it burned out.  Both flashes were in the exact same spot and the shooting star was significantly higher in the sky.  The best way to explain it would be a circular or oblong, controlled orange\/yellow\/red fire in the sky.  Extremely bright.","322":"gold orb in and out of atmosphere Gold in color, possibly fireball but very small.  i believe it to be a spiritual entity.

It was on the tail of a pink , fast moving disc.  The fighter jet was right on the disc's rear.  The disc was flying low, quiet, no wings, and the fighter jet was right behind it.  Then they flew behind high trees and obstructed my view.  They again were heading in the north easterly direct.   My husband saw the jet and naturally heard it.  My neighbors heard it, too, but didn't see it.   Again it was so loud, I didn't know where to go, because I thought it was a passenger jet in trouble.

It was probably the worst video I have ever taken.  But at least I got something on my phone.  My wife was just as baffled as I was, watching this bright light move around and then disappear.   She had went back inside, and I stayed out for a few more minutes and I saw another appear.    This one was a little different instead of being bright white it was a faint reddish color. It also moved towards the same direction as to where the bright light craft disappeared. Funny thing is I was taking a video and could not record the reddish UFO.

Dear NUFORC,  First and foremost, I would like to say \"thank you\" for the work that you do. It was a lovely, clear Saturday and I was home after directing morning music rehearsals at a local church.  I was elated because the early evening was beatific in its summer breeze. Coming home to perfect summer weather was nice, as our church building has a cold-and-spooky vibe that leaves me drained. I was standing up on my porch, just enjoying the blue sky while my friend sat down to check her texts, when I suddenly saw something 25-50 ft overhead - something that I still cannot explain, as I have found little to no evidence. It was a highly reflective, metallic, glittery, shapeless poof of sparks that resembled blinking stars or fireworks.  The blob was about 5 ft in length, had many sparks, appeared out of thin air and disappeared the same way. Toward the end of its appearance, the sparks seemed to coordinate with one another to  make a formation that reminded me of a flock of birds flying very high overhead, at sunset.  I can definitely confirm that this was not that.  This was especially strange to me, and reminded me that I have a friend who has been researching UFO's for many years, and that she has found that they like to hide by imitating their environment. Back to the event, I was slack-jawed by what I was seeing, yet immediately alarmed my friend who was not able to look up from her screen to see the 2-5 second event.  I would like to add that we were soberly sharing food, and that I don't suffer from any type of hallucinations.  Finally, I was not scared at all by the proximity of this sighting...just blown away.","344":"It is a round object with grey or black stripes across the middle that appear to be windows.

It was oval and glowing white.  It was in the daylight. We looked at it with a camera and zoomed in on it and also looked with binoculars.  There was a dark center or design on the middle of the oval.   I personally did not get any pictures, but others did and I do not know them.

My location is in a rural area surrounded by rolling hills and forest.  I immediately pulled out my smart phone and started recording.  I have the entire event on video with audio.  Within only a few seconds the object was almost directly overhead, moving fast and it appeared to be glowing orange.  The speed of the object appeared to be similar to a jetliner.  Over the next 30-40 seconds, the object continued south and flickered briefly, then disappeared entirely.   In this area, we see a lot of falling stars, satellites, and aircraft.  This was unlike anything we've ever seen.  More unusual was the object appeared to be guided rather than falling.","352":"Multiple disc shaped lights that disappeared,  reappeared, and multiplied. There were approximately four lights flying in the air in some kind of formation and changing formation from straight line to a v and so forth.

A moment later, there was another flash further along suggesting the object had traversed a great distance before flashing again suggesting the that the object had moved a good distance between flashes. I immediately thought it was odd and anticipated a third flash but it did not come.  I searched with my binoculars and could not find a source.  I thought perhaps they were flares from another jet perhaps associated with the formation I had just seen.  But there was no lingering burn descending to earth. I am a private pilot and well connected with DoD types as well as amature radio. By no means am I a sensationalist.  However, these flashes were an oddity in all my years associated with the sky.","362":"MADAR Node 151","363":"5 lights stood still then went southwest then 10 seconds later 2 appeared and left southwest , 1 faster than the other I was outside snake river t Idaho falls, it was around 2:50 am , I saw 5 circular lights that were in a formation , they were still for about 3 seconds then they started picking up speed and flew southwest, then I waited for 10 seconds then I saw 2 of them and they went the same direction but 2 faster than the other","364":"Two witnesses of 5-10 minutes of fast flying, direction-changing object Was watching stars at 3am on a boat dock.  Really clear night.  No nearby light pollution from cabins or anything since we were about 300 yards out into the lake. Super clear night.  Was beautiful stars. Me and one other both noticed a light fly by at the same time.  Way up in the sky.  Definitely outside of the atmosphere to eliminate the possibility of it being a plane, drone, etc. It also changed direction and speeds at random.  It would fly one direction for 1-2 seconds then stop.  Then change directions and fly a few more seconds.  Then stop. Sometimes the lights would pulse, sometimes they were off.  Sometimes it would change direction while the light was off then it would appear off to the side. The speed and quickness it would change directions (not fly only straight) eliminated any possibility of it being identifiable. It was too high up to see any detailed characteristics.  Couldn't really tell the shape or size.  But 100% was flying, had lights, was fast, and would fly in different directions.","365":"There was a flashing light which was changing colors zooming through the sky. two of us were watching the stars at 4am when we both jumped at the sight of a fast moving circle flashing gold, red, blue, and green extremely fast.  The body traveled across the sky and seemed as though it was able to zig-zag through the air.  i did not really believe that aliens had any involvement with earth until i saw this. the light was bigger than the stars and bigger than the lights from satellites and planes.   When we tried to video, our phone could not pick up the light.","366":"Saw 2 shooting stars and sat down to look at stars. What at first appeared to be bright star suddenly popped up.  It was oval shaped and had red and white and green fast moving lights, much much faster than a plane.  It wobbled in a very strange way and sort of seemed to drunkenly stagger around in its movements and then moved slowly away in the opposite direction.","367":"Two glowing orange objects seen speeding across the sky with flames coming out of them. When walking outside we saw a boat looking object speeding across the sky.  It had a very strange orange glow to it and upon focusing on it it had three large flames burning on it. Once it was noticed another object exactly like the first but much closer also came speeding across the sky.  It too was boat shaped and had three large flames burning on what would be like the \u201cdeck.\u201d  Although there were flames coming from it they weren\u2019t on fire because they continued to fly until out of site traveling from West to East. The bizarre thing was the three flames coming off the objects were almost cartoon like.  They each maintained a single flame like shape which never varied and they all put off a huge orange glow which was consistent and did not flicker. It was not a meteor or firework as they did not have a downward trajectory nor did they make a sound.  They remained flying at the same height and maintained a forward trajectory.","368":"It was a dark cylindrical object.  It was traveling from the north to the south.  Clear blue skies.

I got my binos out and we noticed a transparent ring around them, and also red, green and yellow lights circling around the top of the objects.  They disappeared right before our eyes.","372":"Me and my sister saw a strange light rise up from the horizon, move like I have never seen any aircraft move, all while making no noise Me and my sister were walking our dogs around 9-10 o\u2019clock at night when we saw some sort of circular light rise up incredibly fast from the horizon.  It looked like a circular white light with a smaller red light towards the top of it.  It seemed to have a slight disc shape, but due to distance and my glasses lenses, it was hard to tell if it was a glare from my glasses or simply a blur from the distance.  It made no noise. it stopped in place for a few moments before beginning to accelerate incredibly quickly and make super smooth and quick turns.   It was hard to tell the speed of the object, since it was so far away, but it did go significantly faster than any aircraft I have ever seen before and it was silent.  It continued in that pattern, occasionally stopping in place.  Eventually, it disappeared behind some trees and emerged a few minutes later, but this time it was blinking like a plane would, but it continued the irregular movements from before.  It disappeared again behind the same trees and then soon emerged again, now it wasn\u2019t blinking but was a solid light like before, but we saw it change to start to blink again.   It then drifted back down to the same general area it initially rose up from, and me nor my sister saw it again.","373":"Bright as a planet with a dark orange glow.  Traveling West to East, high in the night sky then disappeared.","374":"It started as a circular beam of light and after acknowledging it it began to spin very fast then zoomed out of sight","375":"While looking into the early night sky facing S\/W from our location a large bright object appeared having just passed by a bright crescent moon.  This bright light had not been visible to us prior to the passing of the moon.  This light was extremely bright and the light was a steady white light.  Neither pulsating or fading in intensity.   We attempted to view with binoculars and in doing so the image was fuzzy but there was an outward appearance as if this light was in fact three or four separate bright lights joined into one object.  There were absolutely no running lights as would be normal for an aircraft or helicopter.  There was no discernible noise.  The night sky was clear and the air calm.   This light travelled on a slow steady and constant rate moving from the west north-west to the east south-east in the direction of the Fredericton International Airport.  A distance from our observation location of approximately 12 kms.  The airport was active with visible aircraft taking off and in the approach area's.   As this bright constant light approached the perimeter air space of the airport it speed which had been constant increased slightly and the entire light disappeared completely from the night sky.  There was nothing to indicate the light was an aircraft on an approach for landing.  When the bright light literally \"switched off\" it was still travelling in the same direction and was an estimated height of at least several hundred to a thousand feet in height.","376":"Large & shiny tic tac hovers and then flies off. While on a ski trip to Mammoth, we witnessed what we first thought was a drone hovering above us.  We couldn\u2019t get a handle on its size or distance for several minutes as it didn\u2019t make any sense to what we knew was possible.  It was shaped like a very shiny Tic Tac, perhaps 10 feet long.  It was hovering then would drop and ascend very rapidly.  My 14 year old step daughter became quite afraid, while I assured her it had to be some sort of drone, but I don\u2019t think any of us was buying my story.  We watched it for the duration of the chair lift, the group behind us seeing it as well.  After about 8 minutes it flew off into the interior of Yosemite.

It was just after dusk so the sky was dark but not completely.  My garage faces east towards the Connecticut river, and as I was walking to my car I saw something in the sky in that direction.  Hovering above the river g (or close to it), was an object consisting of four lights, either in a diamond or rectangular pattern, with one light blinking in the center. I was probably only a quarter of a mile away.  It gently, and silently bobbed there for a minute or two before it lowered to a point where it was blocked from view by a neighbors house. I then went to my car and started to drive down River road towards Whately and before I got too far I came to a field so I decided to look back to where the object was.  It was still there above the river just hovering silently like before.  A silent cluster of lights.  After a few minutes I decided to walk back to my car, and before I got in I glanced back and it seemed to have disappeared again.  Definitely a first time sighting of anything remotely like it.","379":"Seen several what looked to be planes but had no wings.

I am very familiar with helicopters and plans as we live in the middle of 2 bases one is a helicopter base the other is an air force base where they fly jets, ospreys, c-130s and other aircraft.  This object displayed none of the normal light arrays of standard aircraft.  The object moved in a relatively straight trajectory from south to north.  The sighting was approx. 3 min.

Two huge slightly slanted, rectangular, \u201dneon green,\u201d lights, both the exact size, one on top of the other.  (they were slanted due to the speed they were falling closely resembled an equal sign)  It disappeared behind clouds and the mountain-possible water or national park area...  I did not hear it crash.  I could not see any indication that it did. I pulled over to view a map and see which roads would be best to cut over the mountain and follow the trajectory.  (because that is totally safe and makes perfect sense  Right?!) While I did, I saw a falling star,  I got out of my car looking at the sky.  Got locked out.  It took an hour for roadside.

As we continued to watch the sky, I saw three disc shape objects in a triangle formation flying by.  They were well over 30,000 feet in the sky.  The discs looked identical.  They were equally half white and half of a grey shade with a dividing line of symmetry along a diagonal line.  They seemed to just be floating by in the clouds. There was no sound that I could hear from the objects.  Not sure what to make of it.  Could be spacecraft from another world.  It could be government technology that disguises jet aircrafts.

We thought perhaps the lights were those Asian lanterns people sometimes send off into the sky but the lights which were originally moving in synchronized movement all stopped except for the first light in the row.  It took off, while the others waited behind it and then the first light completely disappeared.  Then the next orange light in line took off northward over the beach and disappeared over us.

As I walked out into the night air, I suddenly stopped in my tracks and looked up (I still don\u2019t know why or what reason I did that) as my friend continued walking.  It was that strong sense you get when someone is looking at you that drew me to look up, I think. (I don\u2019t know which direction, like NW, SE, etc. \u2026sorry, I\u2019m a girl) \u2013 but I can tell you I was in Hillsboro, OR, in the Orenco Platform District.  Though its light(s) were very dim at first, my eyes locked on it immediately.  It was way too high up to be a plane (and a few did cross underneath as I stared).  It blinked at me slowly, as if acknowledging that it was seeing me (or watching the area).  The light strobed from soft white to yellow to blue and red, in random order.  It was stationary, hovering, but it would jerk to its left or right in a millisecond, then up or down, but for the most part, remained in its general spot high up in the clouds. Then I started noticing other lights just like it in the clouds, in the periphery.  Together the lights formed a gigantic circle, outlining some kind of enormous craft half-hidden behind the clouds, and just\u2026surveying.  I sat out there for a good 45 minutes and it continued to blink and slightly jolt and return to its position.  And it was clear there were many others with him\u2026or it.

As jet gets close, both UAP and jet suddenly disappear. My friends and I were returning home, traveling north on Rte 54 (Patriot Freeway).  At about 3:01 pm I noticed a fighter jet taking off from Biggs Airfield at Fort Bliss, El Paso, TX.  As I watched it ascend, it began to turn East away from me as it climbed rapidly.  I thought its flight path unusual, and continued to watch it ascend towards a bank of clouds above it.  The jet turned so sharply that its wings were vertical to the ground as it made a U-turn back towards the South.  Then I noticed an object hovering just below the clouds over Biggs Army Airfield.  I recognized it as a UAP or UFO, and grabbed my cell phone camera.  It took me a few seconds to get the camera operating.  By that time the jet was rapidly closing the gap with the UAP.  In response, the UAP began to back up and move away from the approaching jet.  I was stunned!  I aimed my camera and pushed the shutter button, but my cell phone camera did not respond fast enough.  Suddenly both the UAP and jet both disappeared.  The photograph time is 3:03 pm, taken just after the jet and UAP disappeared.  I asked my friend, who was driving, and he said he didn't see it.  He is an audio witness to my sighting.  I have no idea what happened to that jet.

The picture recorded the date and time of the photograph, and even GPS location of our car at 3,000 Gateway North Boulevard (access road to the Patriot Freeway).  Visibility was excellent at 10 miles.  I overlaid the photo with an image of what type of UAP\/UFO I saw and the type of jet, as best as I could make out from four miles away (map distance).  I added dots to mark the path of the jet as it made a high-angle U-turn towards the UAP\/UFO. I posted this picture and account on my Facebook profile, and had a number of responses.  Ted Roe of NARCAP made an interesting comment:  T. R. (NARCAP)  My guess.... plane was too close when the ufo bolted, inside the envelope when it jumped.  Probably carried the plane with it to where ever it was when it stopped... F18....

Just a brief, possibly 3-4 seconds and then it appeared to have closed into themselves, but no single light, it just disappeared, lights just turned off.   Like turning on a light then turning a light off that quick. These were bright white lights, no color.  Sudden valley is very quiet, there was no sounds heard.  All three lights, together about the size of little finger nail at arm's length.","416":"It was Cigar shaped, Fluorescent Orange & Brighter at Both Ends, Positioned Horizontally & Slowly Moving East. It was around lunch time with clear skies (no clouds what so ever) & it was Brighter than Anything I've Ever seen in the sky on a clear day!  It must have been far from me because it was small, but the shape & brightness of the color made it hard to miss. It caught my attention as a helicopter was flying low over my house & as I looked up at it I saw the object.  I was facing South looking in the direction of the Gulf of Mexico.  I looked at it for about 3 minutes as it slowly moved East.\u00a0 Then the brightness of it started to dim, almost like it was about to disappear when it turned facing away from me and away from Earth & toward SPACE...  Then it disappeared.","417":"Pictures taken from unknown solid object over Sauerlach (Germany) on May, 10th 2019 I have taken pictures with my camera Canon IXUS 265 HS at my home in Sauerlach (Germany) on May 10th, 2019.

There has also been no noise heard of an airplane or a drone or anything else resembling a normal human aircraft at this time.  The object moves from the far left at the same height of the moon (the moon is in the middle of the picture) and on the fourth and last shot under the moon.  The surface of the object reflects the sun and cast a shadow on itself.  The object appears to move to different sides itself and it is a bit blurry around it as if it has some kind of force field which surrounds it.

It had multiple green lights on the bottom of the plane around the perimeter of the oval.  It made no noise, confirmed by a plane flying by in a similar area later in the night.  It continued in a straight line for about 8 or 10 minutes, then switched flight pattern to right (from our point of view.)  Continued within that line for few moments, then back to the same continuous line as before and flew out of sight.  Still going the same speed throughout the entire sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date.","420":"Last night August 5th, 2019, myself and 3 other witnesses encountered a UFO sighting at exactly 23:35.  The event lasted 4 minutes.  We were driving through Harriman State Park in Rockland County, NY (approximately 45 minutes north of NYC), the roads are unlit after dark which made the experience even clearer to see.  We saw 3 individual crafts, disc shaped with 2 lights on each craft in a triangle formation and the 3 objects were completely stationary in the sky.   I proceeded to pull over immediately after sighting this and confirmed with my 3 passengers that we were all seeing the same thing.  Everyone confirmed.  The moment I turned my headlights off, the 3 craft, still in formation, increased their altitude suddenly, then proceeded to move to the west at an incredible rate of speed.  They went from zero to what seemed like thousands of miles per hour in the blink of an eye.  As they moved west they gradually increased altitude until they were no longer visible. The total time we watched this was 4 minutes, so at 23:39 the event was over. I am a former EMT\/Paramedic, the 3 people I was with were 1.  Retired NYPD Sergeant,  2. A Trauma\/ER Nurse and 3.  Former US Marine Force Recon Soldier, all of us I firmly believe are very credible, reliable and completely sane.  Nobody was under the influence of any drug or alcohol. I had an experience in Harriman State Park approximately 20 years ago, but I was by myself so never reported it.  In that instance I saw a glowing green light about 5 feet over my car (I could see it through my sunroof) speed past me very low to the ground at an alarming rate of speed, then took off into the sky and disappeared.  I'm completely skeptical, but I do know what I saw on both occasions and am really glad I wasn't alone this time.  If you'd like further details please contact me.  Thank you.","421":"MADAR Node 154","422":"I was taking photos at the beach.  I didnt notice anything in the sky until I was home and looked at the photo I took.

While relaxing on my back porch after a long day of work I noticed what appeared to be a flashing satellite.  The trajectory was circumpolar and velocity was consistant with average satellites.  The object was first noticed at the zenith.  The first flash was of approximately -6 magnitude brightness and lasted 3 seconds.  So far this seemed normal for a rotating solar paneled satellite.  Every 22 seconds the object flashed at a consistent magnitude until it disappeared over the northern horizon.   The odd thing is the flashing was consistent brightness as though the light was radiating all directions.  Normal rotating satellites will flash at most twice before the change in orbital position relative to the observer makes the solar panels flash to a single spot on the earth's surface.  The next flash would be hundreds of miles away from the observer one would think.   This is the first time I\u2019ve seen this phenomenon and have seen thousands of satellites in my skywatching. This is my 23rd unexplainable sighting of aerial phenomena. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Aug 07, 2019  Where:  Prince William Sound, (Port Fidalgo) Alaska Duration: Approx. 5 minutes (total) Exact Time:  Approx 11:50pm-12:05am Weather Conditions:  Few low lying wispy clouds, lots of stars.  Still night with no wind. Event:  I\u2019ve documented an intelligent light on three other occasions and wrote a report 4-12-18 on the second sighting last year.  I\u2019ll post the first and second encounter below. Over the winter of 2018\/2019 I set out a game camera to take a photo every hour to try and capture the recurring light that seems to appear in the same location during the night and disappear when seen.  I was able to capture what I believed to be the light but the camera does not take the best low light images. Last night I was waiting for the northern lights to come out to photograph with a couple of guests staying with me when a light appeared over Blight Island to the west while we were sitting around a campfire (fire nearly out by this time and a few stars starting to shine).  I immediately got excited and pointed it out to the guests where they confirmed on seeing it as well.  It formed starting a small light and got brighter turning a red\/orange color.  The guests commented that the light was pulsating.  About 40 seconds had gone by and I told them to keep their eye on it and ran to the office to get my camera with a telephoto lens.  As I ran up and turned the lights on to the lodge deck\/office I heard them yell that it disappeared (approx. saw it for 1 min).  I grabbed my camera and came back and the light was gone.  They said as soon as the lights came on the light \u201cblinked\u201d off.   At the same time I was walking down the steps off the deck my cousin walked around the corned! to join the campfire and asked what was going on.  We told him and after a few minutes of excitement of what just occurred he walked back to his room to get a camera.  I along with the other 2 guests sat back down to wait for it to get a little darker in hopes to see the northern lights when the light again appeared again in the exact same spot.  I spoke up to say there it is and watched it for about 10 seconds.  The other two guests see it as well for another 10 seconds when it slowly starts to disappear and doesn\u2019t get as bright as the first time.  Just then my cousin walks up and misses seeing it a second time.  We sit out for another hour but don\u2019t see anything else.  My cousin and I walk to another cabin and look one last time in the general direction when I spot the light start to form again (approx. 1:30am).  As I point it out and grab him by the shoulder to look, it \u201cblinks off\u201d as I call out its location.  We wait for another 15 mins but decide to go to bed after ! this.  The next morning, I remember that I still had my game c! amera ou t and check to see if the light was captured.  Sure enough it was (low quality).  But I can now show where in location of the sky it forms and circled it in red for others to see where to look.  I believe this is recurring light similar to the Martha lights in TX.  But with an intelligence.   I\u2019ve seen it over several years now starting in 2016, always in the same spot. Sept 13, 2018  Where:  Prince William Sound, (Port Fidalgo) Alaska Title:  Intelligent Light in sky disappears when spotted by observer Duration:  1 minute Exact time: 1:37am Weather Conditions:  Clear sky, lots of stars.  Still night with no wind. Event:  I live in a remote part of Alaska and host fishing and hunting guests when a couple of hunters went missing and I had to call the coast guard to find them.  As the coast guard chopper came into view they started to search to the west of where we were.  As I looked up the coastline from our dock, I watched the chopper looking into different bays and I would run back to the main office (150\u2019) where 3 other people were helping coordinate and to talk to the USCG by phone.  As I was running back and forth a bright light appeared out of no where above Bligh Island to my west.  I had seen this light earlier in the spring (documented on nuforc last year 4-12-2018) and wanted someone else to see the light before it disappeared.  I was afraid to call out from the dock and thought it might disappear and remembered not to focus on looking directly at.  After a few moments of not being able to get anyone\u2019s attention in the main office, I looked directly at it to get a better view! and POOF it disappeared.   I then focused on the situation at hand and we would later find the two hunters safely camped out on a beach who decided to just spend the night in the outdoors without telling anyone.

Still night with no wind. Event:  I was sitting across from a young man (guest) around a campfire when a light came into view and my first impression was that it was an airplane flying at high altitude that the sunset was hitting lighting it up.  Upon pointing it out to the guest he had already spotted it as well and as we both focused on it, it suddenly \u201cblinked out\u201d.  We both thought, \u201cboy that was weird\u201d and never thought again about it.  This was my first encounter seeing this light.","445":"Electromagnetic fields????!!!! We have several sets large windows in our bedroom And we are located around 1100 feet up on a Ridge.  During early hours of the night on 8\/7 into 8\/8 bright lights kept shining through the curtains into our bedroom.  At first I thought it was traffic going by but after it kept waking me up I stood up and open the curtains to see where it was coming from which is when I found out it was coming from my sons car outside in our driveway.  His car lights kept turning on and then off sometimes it only lasted a couple of seconds and sometimes quickly flashed on and off.  As I looked to the south west I could see behind the tree line moving blue red and white light.    My husband woke up to ask what that was all about and I told him and luckily the lights like a craft and then on the car lights again so I sent husband down to see if our son was doing something with his car but my husband went outside and looked around the house and found our son sleeping so he didn\u2019t wan! t to wake him up to ask him.  This morning I ask my son if he was doing something with his car last night and he said no and I asked him if he was maybe rolling over on the key fab and he said no the key fabs battery was dead.  This flashing on and off of car lights happened several times during the night so I didn\u2019t  sleep much there was nothing else I didn\u2019t get up and keep checking outside like I wish I would\u2019ve but my husband gets very irritated when I wake him up but I believe he was even spooked by this incident.

I showed my wife and kids and got the binoculars which just made it a larger reflected ball.  A few minutes later then there where two but the second one was NW about 70 degrees and much brighter.  The first on was about twice as bright as Venus.  The second once about three times the brightness of Venus.  I used my space app and ruled out planets.  As the sun set the bright reflection dimmed and they turned red until finally I could not see them any longer and they were stars out but they had faded away with the sunset.  Unusual floating objects.","456":"On a warm May 14th night in 2019, I received a box in the mail containing new swings for the swing set, and went out to the backyard with my 10-year-old to put them up.  I put up one link when I noticed an unusually bright light in the sky NW 20 degrees that I assumed must be the sun reflecting on an aircraft coming in.  After 10 minutes of not moving, it grabbed my attention.  It was about 2 or 3X as bright as Venus but in the NW.  I was disrupted enough to pull my oldest boy off the Xbox and my wife to see the disturbance.   My son was unimpressed, and my wife didn\u2019t care for anything potentially out of the norm.  I went back in and I grabbed my binoculars to see it better but it only made the light slightly bigger and shakier.  I went back to the swing set with only one link attached so far, reaching to attach the second link I looked up noticed a second reflective object floating in the sky about 40 degrees NW and a little higher where I normally would not se! e anything.  It was twice as bright as the first one.  I brought the wife and kids out to see this one too.  The wife went to bed and the boys back to their Xbox's as I watched both of these stationary reflective objects as they dimmed away and turned from bright white to red then dark red.  Later, as the bats and stars came out at 9:15pm, they faded to nothing. I returned to the backyard the next day earlier this time and to observe the skies to find nothing.  Skies were as usual. Analysis:  I observed these two objects from 8pm to 9:20pm in Brandon, SD on 05\/14\/19.  The first object was noticeable at about 8pm and about as bright as 2X Venus NW 40 Degrees.  At circa 8:15 the second object came into view and was about 3X as bright as Venus and NW70 Degrees and higher of the horizon.  The moon was about half and rising at about 135 Degrees.  I called my Dad in northern ND and he could see the moon but not the reflective objects. The objects didn\u2019t move that I could tell and didn\u2019t blink.  They were bright and faded red as the sun set.  I have lived in this house for 8 years and this was certainly a new experience.

My friend exclaimed \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d     I immediately looked up and saw something in the night sky to the SSE of our location.  As soon as I looked up and saw the first lights, which were three horizontal lights, those lights disappeared as if they were \u201cturned off\u201d.  As those first lights were turning off, another set of three lights turned on, one at a time, then all three staying on for maybe 20 seconds.   Each light was shaped like a thin wide cat\u2019s eye; bright white with an orange glow\u2026.I know the exact time as I had my cell phone in m hand and immediately raised it to take a photo; the object doesn\u2019t  show in the photo.   We sat around speculating what it was and still don\u2019t know.  I believe I could see the form of something behind the lights as if the lights were headlights on the object, whether a plane or whatever it is,  It did look dark.","460":"Driving south on Highway 31, we seen 3 red lights heading in our direction in a vertical pattern.

Both rise slowly, then disappear. Moments later, I saw 4 or five lights in formation flying in that general area, these were flashing.  I watched and several lights just disappeared, but one did a circle and flew back from direction it came from.  I also heard a jet engine.  I wonder if jets were sent to investigate?  Why did several 'jets' disappear?   Also, I took motorcycle ride yesterday to Alzada Montana then to Hulett, Wy,...I saw two different military-style 'outposts with people inside fenced areas.

August 9, 2016   Let me start by saying that I have always believed that we are not alone in this universe.  In the past year I have become more and more interested in finding out the truth and why the government is trying to keep it secret!  I had been watching a tv program called \u201cAncient Aliens: Declassified and \u201cProject Blue Book\u201dwhen I decided that I would watch the sky at night periodically.  I truly wasn\u2019t optimistic about this because I figured my state would obviously have very few sightings if any at all. Two months ago, I was at my sisters house and we were outside on the porch.  I just happened to be looking at the sky between the trees when I saw bright light (I just thought was a star) and just watched for a minute or less because the light was moving then quickly shot across the sky like a flash of light.  I asked my sister if she seen it and she said no and laughed at me.  Since then I haven\u2019t discussed what I see with anyone unless they are at least open to the fact that what I\u2019m saying is true!   I\u2019ve seen few more since then but hadn\u2019t been very consistent with watching the sky.  Last night I decided to go outside with my granddaughter and look at the stars.  It was a clear night and a great night to find\/see a falling star!  My granddaughter went in the open garage to play for a little while and I continued to watch the sky when I noticed that to the left of me, when I began to notice many (more than I\u2019ve ever seen fly in at the same time)  airplanes flying towards our airport. I couldn\u2019t to keep watching because it seemed peculiar and I wondered why.  While I was watching the sky I noticed 2 lights in the sky that almost looked like stars but I noticed that they were kind of twinkling and moving together in the same direction.  First they went right, down, then appeared to be kind of heading toward the airport, when the one I could keep track of made almost a complete circle.  We don\u2019t have anything on Earth that could fly that fast or maneuver in that way! I could not ! make out a shape because it was to far away but the bright light and maneuvering techniques fascinated me enough to find out how to report it and who to report it to!      Thank you for listening.  I hope it wasn\u2019t to long and drawn out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Walking the dog in Parrish, Florida.  To the north, and possibly over Tampa, I see a very bright light shaped like a relatively small orb (probably bigger than a plane would have looked at that distance).  It was moving extremely slowly and had 5 bright beams of light shooting out of it to a good distance and evenly spaced.  The object had a trail of what appeared to be a cloud of smoke behind it in a trail which was erratically shaped as if the object had been mobile for some time and moving from over the ocean toward land.  The trail was not straight, suggesting a non-linear path, and their was no apparent wind as the clouds were still.   Interestingly the \u201csmoke\u201d was lit up, very much in contrast to the clouds around it, of which there were few, so this object was not obscured by clouds.  After a couple of minutes, the object began moving more rapidly (but still very slowly) toward the earth and appeared to be naturally extinguishing itself as it got c! loser.  At this point the projections of light also dimmed and disappeared. When it got a bit over the tree line where I was, it was totally out, but the \u201csmoke trail\u201d behind it continued to glow as if lit up from within, light hues, not just one color but mostly bright white light. I did not bring my phone with me to walk the dog so I could not take pictures.  I ran it to get my wife to look but at that point is was already almost out.

Grew larger in size and emitted red downward beam. Time is approximate and is GMT.  It was night time and the sky was dark. I was travelling in a car with 2 others, my friend (the driver) and my partner who was in the back seat.  I was in the front passenger seat (left seat in English car, and also driving on left side of the motorway).  We had been to see Nightwish at the Birmingham Arena, so the date is accurate.  The time is approximate.  We were driving home north from Birmingham up the M1.  The location would have been close to the west of Leicester or Nottingham.  I could see a city to the east of the road, but uncertain which one it was.  They're not that far apart anyway.   I saw a red light in the sky fairly low down, but above tree height.  Height is difficult to guess as we were moving.  It looked like a large star.  I thought it unusual, but I initially thought maybe it was Mars.  It began pulating and appeared to grow larger.  A broad red beam emerged downwards from the pulating light.  The beam had well defined edges, but the strange thing was that the beam did not fade out at the bottom, but had a well-defined flat bottom edge.  Just then we passed a row of trees on the left side of the road blocking my view of it.  When the car had passed the row of trees the light and beam had gone.

A minute later I see it again only instead of way out in front of me it was now to the left.  This is when I noticed it moving in ways I can't explain.  Vertical, horizontal, stationary.  Would shine bright white and go back to flashing red.  This time it started to get further away.  I happened to have my flashlight on me and I started flashing it in it's direction.  It then went white and stayed white and came out in plain view to me. It's night and there was no way of making out the shape but I felt like it gave me the time of day for about 10 seconds.

At first, I thought it was just a small star until I saw it start moving.  Then I thought it was a plane but saw no blue or red lights blinking.  It was also moving TOO slow to be a plane.  Then just as I was about to tell my mother, it vanished.  I tried to find it and soon it appeared a few feet from its first location and it was extremely bright again and still moving slowly.

At 9:40pm looking directly over the North Carolina ocean on a clear night with a half moon, we saw first one, then 2, deep orange glowing orbs over the ocean at an angle of 30 degrees.  On this night, that means these lights appeared stationary, halfway between the ocean horizon and the half moon.  From Ocean Isle Beach, 30 degrees into the sky and almost straight out into the ocean, but more like 20 degrees to the right\/south.  Which was almost directly under the half moon at this time on this date. 3 nights prior, my brother and I saw a green fireball (meteor I assume) Bright green and going straight down into the water, directly straight over the ocean (probably burning up prior to hitting).  This night was another clear night and I was on the beachfront deck with 3 others: My wife, my friend, and my sister.  All 4 of us witnessed the event: brief but long enough for everyone to turn their heads and witness enough of it (both lights). The event itself: 1 deep orange stationary light appeared in the sky. It was about the overall luminosity of the half moon in the sky, so quite bright.  More of an orb than a small point.  Since we were spotting meteors, I yelled to look at that one coming right at us.  (Thinking it was a large fireball headed directly at us since it appeared stationary.)  But then it lasted too long and didn't move, and then started going out exactly as a 2nd one started glowing. Briefly this was like 2 orange headlights in the sky coming at us.  As a guess, it seemed like 3 miles out over the open ocean at a 30 degree angle into the sky off the horizon.  No boats in the area (some to the distant left and right), and no planes in the sky, at least none anywhere to be seen with lights on them.  Visibility was strong, with the milky way band of stars visible directly overhead despite the half moon. The 2 orange lights only lasted about 15 seconds and each appeared stationary, and locked, horizontal to each other.  Based on the distance away they appeared like they were 1\/10 of a mile apart in the sky.  The first light lasted 6 seconds, then started to fade concurrent with an equal and opposite brightening of the 2nd light to the right of the first light.  Then the original light was gone and the light to the right was on, for about 5 additional seconds, then both were gone.  They came on and off but didn't move otherwise. I went online to see if this is common in NC, and it's ultra common over the last 20 years.  Lots of people seeing this type of thing and not a lot of good theories.  But this video from 6 months prior seems to show exactly what the 4 of us witnessed:  https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GkUs79K940E   Closest guess would be military exercises, flares on parachutes.  But the lack of planes and the lack of smoke trails and any movement at all are an issue.  Also, some other events seem to last longer, this one was rather fast and not useful for flares unless they failed somehow.  Kind of a Chinese lantern glow but it was super windy that day and there was no movement, and we were watching the sky all night for meteors and I'm not sure how they could get out over the ocean and only ignite themselves briefly like that.  The shutting off of the one on the left and concurrent turning on of a new one on the right make it 10x more eerie than if it was just one odd light, because it seemed like it could signify intelligent intent - which could of course be a coincidence. When filing these reports does anyone get back to you to say what it was, or to see if they can confirm if there were military exercises off the coast of NC that night?  In the above similar event video online, it was in December and on a Tuesday rather than a Thursday night, but they said it happened \"between 9 and 10 pm\" which was a match, also a match in terms of appearing out in the ocean and slightly to the right.  Though above video appears like a 20 degree angle and our event was a bit higher in the sky. Just after and seemingly unrelated, way to the left\/north up the coast was a very distant storm cloud with frequent lightning within the cloud, looking like stranger things type movie effect.  Visible lighting but eerie, and all within 1 cloud.  Very distant though and to the left rather than straight\/right, where there were no clouds, boats or planes.  Though I guess that means some sort of exotic orange ball lighting could an angle.","495":"Saw flying glowing object above in the sky not so high above.  It was about ten steps away from me.

I travel this way several nights a week and always watch the air traffic around SeaTac and McChord Field.   Tonight, I saw an aircraft I first thought was an airliner on the SeaTac glideslope, but it was kind of odd.  It had one bright white light that strobed (like two blinks, pause, two blinks), a solid white light, and a fainter solid red light.  They didn't look particularly unusual for aircraft lights, just in a configuration I've never noticed before.  I can't even say that description of the lights is completely accurate - I was driving, and assuming it was just an airplane, not paying that close attention - but something along those lines. After a few minutes, I realized it wasn't an airliner, it was hovering at a few hundred feet just west of the highway.  I assumed it was a helicopter.  I glanced up at it as I passed, and nope, it was a perfect dark grey or black triangle, with the lights at the tips.  I'd say it was hovering at maybe 200-300ft and maybe about 40ft on a side, and I didn't notice any noise. I wasn't able to stop or go back, but I watched it in my rear-view mirror and it didn't seem to move much, if at all.  I drove around a bend out of sight after maybe half a minute. Even at 00:45, I-5 close to SeaTac is a fairly busy highway.

The bright light slowly approaching the roadside leaving me to think mabey a dirt bike with very bright headlamp was going to pull out in front of me so I eased on the breaks.

I saw a large object in front of me off to the left side in my windshield and it was lit up.  At first I thought it was a helicopter just hovering over the treeline.  This was not way up in the sky, this was just over the tree line.  As I kept driving, I began to see more lights on this and since the sky was not fully dark, I could see the entire outline of the shape of the object and immediately knew this was not a helicopter, and it was sitting completely still.  This was a long oval shaped disc, and it was not sitting horizontally to the ground, it was tilted up on it\u2019s side, like diagonal.  So I could see the top of it facing the highway I was on.  It had many bright lights on it \u2013 white, red, blue, green, yellow and was really quite beautiful.

I kept describing it to him and as I drove, it sat completely still, I heard no noise and now as I am driving it is now in my side driver\u2019s window as I looked out.  I thought about pulling over to take a picture, but it wasn\u2019t safe to do so on this road and this thing was really too close, I didn\u2019t want to stick around.  I kept looking back and forth from the road to my window, and at some point, I looked at the road and then looked back in the direction of the object and it was just gone.  All the lights were gone, everything gone and nowhere to be seen. I have never witnessed anything like this in my life.  It really was beautiful, a little scary at the same time, and very close to the treetops, not even way up in the air, so very easy to see.  Much larger than what a helicopter or anything would be, so it was not a drone.  This was definitely some sort of a large craft, very lit up, and sitting completely still, at an angle.","506":"3 fireballs or flare like lights above the ocean that quickly disappeared.

I\u2019d say they could be flares but does the military typically drop flares off the coast this far from a base?  They didn\u2019t last long like flares either.  It was very quick.

Then a huge orange red long object came spinning at us vertically with other small orange red objects shooting out of it.  Very beautiful.  It disappeared and then another one, a little bigger came and did the same thing.  Awesome.","508":"I saw nine orange pulsating lights originate from the the horizon in same NW area of Spokane lasting a duration of 20 minutes At around 10:10 pm, I was on my front porch, when I noticed a strange looking orange pulsating light (star or planet or plane size).  It had no noise, usually when planes are seen at that distance you can hear them.  Then a second light came out from the same NW place on the horizon (right of Division on the north side for Spokane people).  They were both following the same flight pattern and extremely close, heading diagonally to about a 45 degree angle then just disappearing.  They originated from the same spot and vanished from the same spot.  I continued to watch five more come out at the same spot and vanishing at the same spot during 5 minutes.   Then my fianc\u00e9 came out and saw two more do the same thing.  Then we saw two come, one right after the other, from the same spot on the horizon and then just hovered diagonally (about 2 inches apart, if I held my fingers up to measure).  Then one slowly disappeared followed shortly by the other. This happens once more an! d I am able to catch a little on video.   In total, I saw 9 lights in a course of twenty minutes, all dark orange pulsating, all originating from the same area past the NW horizon.","509":"Strange rectangular light shines down on Backyard appears then disappears after 4 minutes and 10 seconds in Simpsonville Kentucky. I have security cameras pointed to our backyard from inside my house.  I was looking at one and noticed a light that appeared to be coming from an object above and was shining on the grass. First there was one light then another seemed to turn on a second or so after the first one.  They appeared to be spot lights with a rectangular shape. The lights lasted for 4 minutes and 10 seconds and turned off as suddenly as they turned on. I looked outside while the lights were visible but could not see anything directly above from my window, but they could have been coming from something higher up in the sky.

Then disappeared. It was very fast, the same size as a falling star but the only way we could tell it wasn\u2019t is that it looked like when a plane is on a runway and speeds up.  We didn\u2019t see a ship because it was in a dark area of the sky and this little glow suddenly appeared in the sky, got bigger as it gained speed, then disappeared.","512":"Slow-moving Cigaresque Craft On the evening of August 9, 2019, I observed a cigaresque craft travel very slowly at an extremely high altitude passing across my view of the moon.  This was at approximately 9:10 p.m.  The craft disappeared into the clouds after roughly 6 seconds and only a few seconds later, a commercial airliner was traveling a perpendicular path to the cigar craft at a lower altitude at regular-plane speed.","513":"Round orbs of light with bright flashes of light in sky over Aberdeen, Wa.

But it had no actual surface.  it was a cloud like glow with a very defined perimeter.it defiantly was iluminated from a powered source.  Im relating the speed of the craft to multables of the usual planes that fly over head daily .  actualy every 15 min to land.  So they move at about 180 mph this moved so fast.

I was outside smoking a cigarette and I noticed this light right in front of me in the sky and was coming closer, it was dark cold and very bright.  Prior to this I have seen other objects in the sky a few times and normally when I go to explain what Ive seen No One Believes Me , so I decided to take a video.  Please ignore the first 1t seconds as it is just crickets chirping in the backgroind.In my video you can clearly see the different movement on the craft.

Very erratic in flight.","523":"Brightest thing in night sky followed by obviously military aircraft at very low altitude It was about 21:45 EST May 17, 2019 one mile SW of Cedar Run, Pennsylvania. I was sitting with my girlfriend at the dinner table listening to the radio getting ready to turn in.  We have expansive plate glass windows facing SE offering a good view of the mountain opposite and a good deal of the sky above.  It was a largely clear night, moon within 24 hours of full, high in the SW.  She told me to look up to the South where I saw a silent highly luminous object (not reflecting but emitting light), the brightest object in the sky, so bright no shape could be discerned save that of any bright source of light (like a star), no larger than a small single engine plane.  We watched as it crossed very slowly perhaps no more than a few hundred feet overhead moving in a unerring easterly direction.  We exited the house to watch as it passed into the distance in complete silence.  At more than a mile\u2019s distance we began to hear the very low rumble of a jet engine, a sound th! at a commercial flight would make very far off on the horizon.  To our surprise it was a four engine jet with minimal running lights moving in the same path as that of the still visible object.  I say surprising because it was so low; low enough, I dare add, to actually read lettering on the wings if it had any to read in the daylight.  It was NOT a commercial airliner - much too low and quiet for that.  What\u2019s more, the wings were far up on the fuselage directly behind the cockpit, meaning it was built for speeds beyond that of any commercial craft of that size.  It WAS a military aircraft, and it WAS following at roughly the same speed and altitude as the object with no apparent intent to close the distance or intercept this UFO until both slipped over mountain on the eastern horizon.","524":"I was doing pushups on the terrace of my house. The sky was dark. No stars were visible. As I stood up for a while to take some rest, i saw a light coming down from the sky.  First I thought it was a meteor, I kept looking at it. Two seconds after a long fall from the sky, the light disappeared.  Till now everything it meant to me was a meteor.  But suddenly , after a pause of a second, the light came and disappeared. It continued to reappear after every second. 5-6 seconds after this whole event, it changed colour from white to blue.  The light continued to beep. Now it started a strange motion.  Going left , then right as if searching for something, hovering in the sky.  When it did not get anything in that area it suddenly got speed and left a red trail behind for approx 3 seconds. The light now shifted to another area.  It was heading up towards a tower and continued to beep after every second.  The beep I refer is the continued disappearance and reappearance of light. Now it changed its colour to white for at least 5-6 seconds and then again blue.  As i got near a tower, it stayed there for a while approximately 6-7 seconds and then it started to faint.  The light got dim and completely disappeared. The event, by my approximation happened a mile away.  There was no sound that came to me.  This event just freaked me out.  Also this is not a joke or a hoax to be ignored.  Also I can well distinguish between a mysteriously flying object or some laser light.

Michigan I was looking out at a star but this star is somewhat odd because it seemed to have different color lights admitting from it.

Then all of a sudden 3 quote large spot light orange lights, very low in a v like shape appeared right out of no where!  The three lights looked like they were right over our house.  They stayed in the v for about 10 seconds.  I grabbed my phone and flashed a picture and they then started moving in a fast circler way and just disappeared completely after about 30-45 seconds.  It was like they just came out of the stars. Afterwards tons of planes started roaming the same area.

I began to get alarmed as I thought it was two planes about to collide.  The plane passed the object and it was right underneath the moon.  The object was round and all black and I could only see it as the moonlight glinted off of it.  I could see it from my home and immediately had my mother come view it as well.   The object didn't move and we observed it for approximately 45 mins.  The object just hovered and didn't seem to move though once it disappeared for a second but then came back.

We saw it for about 90 seconds.","533":"Blinking white lights looked like rotating object in the night sky; moved oddly and then stayed it the same place 5-10 minutes. Above the horizon level to the moon I could only see a row of white lights blinking in succession; the way the lights were blinking it looked like object rotating, but there was no way to know for sure.   In the parking lot of Walmart in Columbia, looking south towards the 1\/2 moon and Jupiter, I was in my car and watching the lights flash oddly.  About the size of regular stars.  Lived in this area 50 years so I know what helicopters, planes, and such look like taking off from BWI, National, Dulles etc but this was very different.  \\ It moved to the right, then down slowly, and seemed to zig zag and flash intermittently.  Then it stayed still for several minutes while it kept spinning (or blinking lights in quick succession in a row).  I was going to go home but instead got out of the car and watched it.  The lights did not recede while it stood still for 5-10 minutes at least (same size).   Then it very slowly started to move straight downward in the sky.  I checked! my cell phone to see what it could be; when I looked back it was gone.  I wanted to show someone else, but that Walmart parking lot is iffy and I wouldn't talk to anyone else there in the dark.","534":"First noticed two stationary T shaped objects with vertical lighted up be had purple and one had white lights.  As I began to examine the sky, I noticed more moving gluiding almost as if remote controlled.  Very angle andistamce I looked there were more and more. Some at greater depths and so which seemed closer.  A few were flying in almost identical patterns and the 2 stationary ones never moved not even an inch.  As I looked in different directions and noticed them everywhere I felt as if there was some kind of invasion.  I called 2 different people with 10 miles and they didn\u2019t see anything.  Also took photo of stationary one but it just turns up at a glowing dot almost looks like a star, so the picture doesn\u2019t do it justice.  About an hour later in went outside to notice the sky went from a clear night to a Bob Ross like like painting with clouds.  I know could not notice the original 2 T like objects due to the thickness of the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The object was circular and the size of a dime.  While it was in the distance, I could tell the flying object was in Earth\u2019s stratosphere. It appeared the UFO was 20-30km from the ground and exploring the mountains in Palm Springs.  I was staying at Sparrow\u2019s Lodge (E Palm Canyon Drive) and was facing South\/South-West at the time of the sighting. To me, the most bizarre thing about the sighting was that the UFO was moving quickly towards the earth.  I suppose I always imagined UFO\u2019s beaming back to space, not towards us.","539":"3am, long cigar shaped, all dark, fast moving object.  No lights but you could see its form bc of reflected moonlight or an aura maybe Around 3am, I saw a \"glimmer\" but not light or a star, etc..  Cigar shaped, completely dark object flew fast, north to south, directly overhead.  No sound, no lights...like a silouette or reflected moonlight bc you could see its form easily.  Could not tell height or size only it was probably large and moved at a rate as if you'd see a helicopter fly by, for example. I watched it for about 10 seconds until I couldn't follow its path due flying over Atlantic City (lots of city lights, etc). It was not a plane of any kind and much too fast for a blimp although its dimensions could be explained as such.  Not a doubt in my mind that this was a craft and would be near impossible to see if not just happening to be looking at stars in the exact location of its \"flight path\".  Will absolutely be looking more in coming days. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It seemed very high up and was moving far too quickly to be any kind of commercial jet.  Also, the fact that it didn\u2019t leave any trail behind it was odd.  It changed direction very quickly by about 30 degrees east of its original path, almost on a dime, and then disappeared over the trees. This was seen over the northeastern part of enfield.

It appeared to be higher than aircraft coming in to land at the Pittsburgh airport and above the cloud deck.  The object was east \/ northeast of Bethel Park, my deck faces east. I went inside and retrieved a pair of binoculars which I keep handy for bird watching.  I was able to observe the object for about five seconds.

I called my husband outside to look at it and he said that whatever it was was very low flying.  We know approximately the altitude of planes going over as we are used to that, yet this was different.  The craft moved at a high speed away from us going east where it started going up and down in the sky and changing colors (red, green, blue).   I freaked out and grabbed my phone and started recording.  At one point, another craft came up to it and then descended away.  The craft continued to hover for over an hour like that.   Being skeptical, I called the sheriff dept to see if anyone else had seen what we saw, no reports at the time of our call.we compared and contrasted through binoculars, the craft vs. Stars to make sure we were seeing what we thought we were and there was no comparison.   The shape appeared to be egg-like and continued to jolt around in the sky.  Several planes went around the object, flying higher or lower than normal.   We watched til we finally went to bed.","549":"Summary - light spotted from my deck!  Last night i went out on my deck to cover my grill.

There is two small private airports in the area but the lights were seen in the opposite direction.   Also, no aircraft to my knowledge could emit that kind of light formation.   It also could not have been a drone because these lights were very far apart.

Tried to match craft with local planes or possible known satellites that were currently in nearby skies but to no avail. (Following phone apps were used for this: Air Traffic, Flight Aware, Flight Radar 24 (w\/Silver Membership) Satellite AR and Heaven's Above). It should also be noted that the Palm Springs airport and air museum is nearby, and being avid sky watchers, the observers have become accustomed to the typical air traffic associated with each.  This was something very different from anything that might be usually seen and did not match any reported callsigns or known aircraft.  Observers regularly use the mentioned phone apps to match aircraft they see to that which is reported and passing nearby or through the airport. Traveling westbound via car on 10 Freeway, exited on Indian Canyon to turn into the North Palm Springs Motel 6 parking lot.  Passenger spotted and pointed out to driver a shiney, silvery-white, disk shaped, wingless craft ascending in the Eastern sky, directly out past the windmill fields.  The center of disk was raised enough to be where this would be where it seems like a pilot could reside.  No sound could be heard, though if it were a plane, the associated sound could have been heard. Sky was perfectly clear, winds the night before had been very gusty and might have kicked up sand but at this time all dusts had settled and only a very slight breeze existed. Spotted at about 60 degrees - the horizon being 0.  At first the craft seemed to climb slowly and steadily in elevation similar to any typical passenger plane, but after about 30 seconds of us observing this, the craft seemed to come to a hovering hold.  What appeared to be doors folded out from under the craft and then back up into it.  The craft then started ascending, up and away, amazingly fast, straight up into the atmosphere; within a matter of seconds, it shrunk from view until it completely disappeared.  No trails were left behind. ((ADDENDUM SUBMITTED BY WITNESS)) Good evening Mr. Davenport, I just wanted to let you know that I got your voicemail about my report and I thank you for taking the time to look over it.  I just wanted to let you know though, that the time I initially reported is the correct time - 10:00AM; I know that might seem a bit unusual, as most reports seem to reference the night, but I have come to notice that there's just as much interesting activity going on in our sky during the day as there is during the night.  Also, there was no evidence of anything left behind, but that's likely due to the elevation of the object and that from its initially high elevation, it only zipped away, higher and higher until vanishing. I'd be happy to answer any other questions you might have. Thank you again, ((END ADDENDUM))","553":"MADAR Node 114","554":"It was white and very small egg shaped.

First saw a bright green light which appeared far out to the left of a long straight shot of road, with a smaller blinking red.  Approximately a 3\/4 mile closer, and I had ruled out airplane\/helicopter, per my trajectory.  Another quarter mile and I slowed while passing it.  I appeared to be fully stationary around 35-40 ft off the ground, above and slightly to the right of a house that sits directly on Lewisburg.  The object was probably no more than 100ft away. It was completely dark out, with no noticeable lights coming from any of the surroundings.  I barely had time to scry its silhouette, but it appeared to be roughly cigar-proportioned, but with more geometric angles with a tip pointing towards the road.  There were two weaker, blinking white lights that started on the small face towards me which angled down around its underbelly geometrically.  The green and red lights seemed to be pointing horizontally or upward, I can\u2019t recall.  I\u2019m thinking it was around 12 (length) x 4 x 4 ft. hard to tell.  No sound that I could hear over the car motor. There were no powerlines, or any other objects around, it was clearly above any trees.  The only explanation I could even begin to consider were two or more drones flying in sync, so that I mistook the \u201clength\u201d.  However, the lights (green especially) were so strong that no drone could sustain that kind of power, let alone waste it by pointing main lights anywhere but downward.","559":"I was driving in my truck doing about 75 to 80mph on the 495 north highway when I saw this large flash on light form..then shoot like a star but only 100feet above ground.  It flashed bright enough to leave a trail in my eyes after I closed them. I had 1 passenger and we both said, \"What the hell was that?\"  And agreed it moved awful strange and disappeared so fast it was not something we could explain.  Too close for a shooting star but looked just like one.  Right above my truck.  Then we felt really emotional over it...  With no explanation.","560":"I was going upstairs (second floor) as I get past my balcony I saw a small tiny round shaped white glowing object in the sky about 16 degree north \u00e8mitting sharp white light.  I couldn't believe my eyes.   I waited for a second to see what it could be it was increasing in size very frequently but with ease and moving very smoothly in a to and fro manner then disappeared.  It was the first time saw anything like this in my entire life.","561":"Have video of light moving erratically in the sky.   A less bright light followed its motions.  Phone died after getting good footage.","562":"Two triangular shapes seen while walking home when dark. We\u2019re walking down the road and saw what looked like an orb then turned into three orbs. Noticed it was a weird triangle shape once above us, not a plane for sure.  It came above us, stopped, stayed there for a bit, then quickly continued moving past us.  When near our house a second one appeared after a fast shooting star.  This object was also a triangular shape.  Both of them would move quick then randomly stop and just hover.","563":"A silver white oval shape remained in sky in same place for more than an hour.

The National Park Service (NPS) prohibits flying drones at the Hatteras National Seashore, and given the fact that the NPS offices were directly below where the object was observed, I took interest in continuing to watch the object,  The object emitted no sound, and became larger over a period of 2-3 minutes and kept circling the Hatteras Lighthouse.  As it became more defined, either becoming larger, or from coming closer to the Lighthouse as a reference point, the object became well defined in shape.   The object completely resembled a 20 foot ocean container hovering approximately 200 feet in altitude and had no visible signs of propulsion or aerodynamic surfaces, just a rectangular dark box and made no sound.  The object slowly hovered and circled the Lighthouse for 2-3 minutes then slowly moved Northeast and disappeared.","565":"Traveling northbound on I-65 close to the Zionsville exit when we looked to the east and saw dark charcoal colored cigar shaped object in the eastern, and we also saw two fighter jets that were also flying at low altitude at a slow speed and were west of us and flew over I-65 going east towards the cigar shaped object.

Coming down Hwy 29 from LaGrange heading into Hogansville, and I clearly saw a light streak from the sky down to behind the treeline in the distance.

A friend and I were traveling east on highway 2, just about 2 miles before the Interstate 90 freeway entrance.  When suddenly to the south direction, I  noticed some very strange lights coming up over the trees heading west as we were going south.   This object was massive, I'd say it was a 1\/2 mile away from our car, and from that distance, I would say that this thing was easily over 500 feet high and 3 to 400 feet wide.  It had two arms protruding out in front of it and it appeared to have a head and face in the middle.  It was making a very loud vibrating sound  and would occasionally rise up higher and was churning the ground up as it traveled and this object looked as if it had a large body or it was riding on a very large machine.   In the morning or when i woke up i had absolutely no memory of seeing this or did I even rememberthat i had filmed ir until 4 days ago when i was going through the video in my phone.  I didn't know what I was looking at when i watched t! he video until i played it a few times and some of that morning started to come back.  I want you to watch the video.  And please help me figure out what we saw.  I can tell you that this thing had a organic like appearance.  It qas a very powerfull sighting.

There was a fairly large star that fell toward the horizon.  It moved extremely fast through the sky, so there was no way it could\u2019ve been a satellite, meridian flare, shooting star, airplane, drone, or space capsule.  It was very far away from us in the sky.  We ruled most of those things out because there was no fire under or around it.

While shooting pictures of my son drinking from a water fountain, a large US flag over a nearby building caught my eye so shot a picture of it, to then return to a couple more photos of my son. Two weeks later, back at home, while reviewing the photos, there is a white unidentified object behind the flag, white in color and what seems a very classical disk. At the time I didn't see any object with my eyes of the optical viewfinder of the camera. If I seen the object I would have shot a burst and tried to track it as long as possible.

The light changed directions moving horizontally over the ocean towards the windward side of Oahu. Light made a small dip down then back up to same horizontal path it previously was in. The light started to dim and then completely disappear when we noticed an airplane traveling in the same direction. The light then reappeared but was dimmer and moved away from the airplane in a direction directly away, along the coastline, from our position and dissapeared again as the airplane continued in a horizontal direction towards the south (inward towards the middle of the island). The light again appeared at a farther distance, along the coastline, one last time before disappearing for the last time. My wife and I were on the tail end of our two week vacation at Pat's at Punalu'u. We did our routine night walk around the complex and sat down on recliners to look out over the ocean since it was our third to last night there.  That is when I noticed the bright light.","577":"7 orange spheres flying in formation. Looking in the eastern sky,I saw a single orange\/yellow sphere of light traveling north to south.  Initially I thought it was a rocket launch as I have seen some in the past,same color,same trajectory.  This remained visible longer than usual and it seemed to turn to the east.   About a minute later I saw two more in formation at a considerable distance apart taking the same path.  About 15 seconds later I saw two more in formation and a third seem to come out of nowhere,again at distance apart and about 15 seconds later a final single one came from the same origin, path and speed.   Please note, there was no sound whatsoever, but there was small aircraft (2) in the air at that time flying east and southeast that I know they couldn't help but seeing what I witnessed.","578":"MADAR Node 122","579":"Did not see the light in the sky. It was sunset and there was some very interesting mid-altitude shadowing that seemed to have no origin and I was hoping to catch a picture of it, while driving, so I could get a better idea of what was causing it when I got back to the hotel. Overall, I had taken 7 pictures while driving on I-235 between Valley West Drive and 50th where I exited.  Of the 7, 6 show the triangle set of lights.

To the left of Parkway some distance away above the tree line I noticed two bright white round parallel lights heading east and then quickly turning  south onto the parkway.   Then suddenly, all these bright white lights appeared and illuminated a 40 foot triangle craft.  We could not believe what we were seeing.   The craft kept moving slowly towards the traffic, the lights looked like they dimmed slightly and then craft dropped to about 50 feet above the road and hovered above the parkway.  Cars were passing under it.   Light was shining through the windows on the top of the craft.   Bottom of the craft had many bright white lights of varying sizes along with raised areas and small square indented panels that looked like glass that emitted soft white yellow lights.  Craft was light metallic silver color.   It did not make any noise.","582":"AC broken in home and cooler in backyard on lounge chair.

Craft was moving very slowly not far above the tree line heading northwest.  Did not hear any noise from the craft in my car despite the low altitude.  I have noticed military craft practicing in this area previously, but I have never seen anything resembling a stealth bomber craft like what I saw tonight.","588":"Two large shadowy chevron\/triangles with amber glow at each point--high in the atmosphere Sky was clear with bright moon.  Was watching for meteors.  (Perseids shower) I had just seen a fiery meteor flash across the sky from east to west.  About a minute after that, I saw two giant (I\u201dm assuming giant because they seemed way higher up than normal aircraft) objects flying silently from northeast to southwest.  One right behind the other.  They seemed like black translucent\/blurry shadowy chevron\/triangles with a dim amber glow at each point of the chevron.  It seemed like they were behind a deep layer of clouds, causing the blur\/glow, but the sky was completely clear last night.  They blurred across the sky silently and gracefully.  There were many planes in the air.  Every single craft made a noise or left a trail.  These were much larger, seemed higher up than any plane and were completely silent.  No sound, no trails.

We were sitting on our porch which faces south.  We saw 3 red lights flying in from the ocean over the Isle of Palms and then to the North.  They were evenly spaced and flying a bit faster than a private plane.  Did not hear any engines.  Shortly there after there were two more red lights on the same path at about the same spacing.  Went to get my binoculars, but when I returned they were gone.  I would have reported this earlier, but only after seeing similar accounts did I decide to report it.  I remember the date because it was Father's Day and we had guests.","590":"My son and I were riding our bikes through our neighbor when he called out my name and drew my attention to an object in the sky.  We then rode back to our house where I decided to take a couple of photographs.  The object was a white or translucent spher reminiscent of a balloon. However it hovered in the same spot for a unusually long period of time.  I also live near an airport so I would think it wouldve been a security risk if indeed it was a research balloon....","591":"Brilliant blue light or object blinded me, then flew away very quickly I was closing a shade in my kitchen at 10:00 pm, when I noticed a brilliant blue object, or light, apparently sitting right on top of a streetlight located approximately 75 feet from my house.  It was a little smaller than a basketball and was a bright medium blue color that cast light around it, and it had a white aura around it.   I watched this object for approximately 30 seconds while trying to figure out what it was, when it suddenly shot backward (NE) at extremely high speed, leaving a trail behind it, and was out of sight in a second.   Then I walked into the living room and noticed that the TV and all the lights seemed extremely bright.  I had to lower the brightness on the TV just to watch it.  Ever since then all lights seem very bright to me and I have to keep my office lights off and can't look at a computer screen for very long.  I have an appointment with an eye doctor because I'm afraid that my eyesight has been permanently affected.  I find it very odd that there were so many reports of unexplained objects earlier on the same day in Kansas City.   I am a UFO investigator and have received reports of small bright red objects, small transparent objects, and multiple witnesses to the two or three objects that hovered over KC for over six hours on the 20th and on other days that week.  Additionally, I received two reports of giant birds the size of an airplane in Independence and Sugar Creek that were seen on the 20th.","592":"Object was long, flat with white light on top moving from left to right hovering high the sky.","593":"I saw two cigar shaped objects, silver in colour, flying at the exact same speed and height.

Suddenly from the top of the clouds a fourth object appeared and met the other three.  At this point all four object flew slowly in a single line diagonally in an upward motion, then down again.  They made a turn one more time and shot up into the clouds above.","595":"Late evening over east lake star watching access to lake looks west to the south was watching what appeared to be a weather event told those I was with it looked strange.

At this time I thought it was 2 crafts continued to watch scouts once a civilian craft was by all ships moved west slowly","596":"At 2:12-2:16 am on July 3,2019 three of us saw something in the sky that we cannot identify. My husband, a friend and I were out at the lighthouse on Sanibel Island, FL hoping to photograph the Milky Way from 12:30-3 am the morning of July 3, 2019.  To do night sky photography, you need to have the camera on long exposure, so 15-30 seconds on a tripod.  We had been shooting from various places near the lighthouse, the pier and the main beach area.  While we were on the small beach area and had our cameras facing toward the lighthouse and the Milky Way we saw lights in the sky.  They came from our right -  over Sanibel end of the bridge - and we all noticed them at about the same time.  I didn\u2019t hear anything, but saw a long, cylindrical (rocket-like) object that looked as if it had flames coming from the middle and end of it.  Around it were 6-10 small lights.  They all traveled at about the same speed and in the same direction, toward Ft Myers Beach.  The small lights didn\u2019t break away from the rocket-like cylinder, they all stayed in the same pattern that we first! observed. At first we thought it was a meteor shower, but none were reported that night.  Then we thought maybe a rocket launch gone wrong, but we none were reported being shot up that night\/morning.  Perhaps it was a satellite breaking up, but the smaller lights traveled at the same speed and in the same direction as the rocket-like cylinder, so didn\u2019t seem to break up. Of course our cameras were facing the wrong direction to catch the unidentified flying objects and were on long exposure, so were useless to catch the UFO.  But I did catch a quick photo with my iPhone and tried to get a movie (tho it isn\u2019t good), though by the time I thought to grab my iPhone, the objects had moved quite a distance away.  You can identify the rocket-like cylinder and a few lights around it as well as the Ft Myers Beach skyline.","597":"Date of sighting:  July 4,  2019 Location: Port St Lucie, Fl Time: Approximately  2020 to 2025  Observation time: Approximately 1 \u00bd to 2 minutes. We were focusing on the object and what it was doing, and observing time could have easily  been over 2 min. The object traveled in a straight line from the SSE to NNW during the entire observation. A little about me: I am an amateur astronomer with thousands of hours of observing time and know the sky well. This includes many naked eye objects and locations of objects that can only be seen with binoculars or telescope. I was in the Air Force and my specialty located me near the runway.  I have observed MANY types of craft and objects in the sky under a variety of conditions. I attended a brief but informative police sponsored training session, provided by a former employer, in looking for and noting details when witnessing an event. I will send you a sketch of the sighting to the address listed on your website, and I intend to contact the local radio station and newspaper. Summary: While in the street, in a residential neighborhood, I noticed a rather bright orange light about 15 degrees above the horizon moving directly towards me.  At first I thought it was a helicopter with a spotlight, but helicopters around here never have orange spotlights, only white. I could only see the bright orange light, and not the body of any craft. As it approached it grew in size until it expanded into an orange orb, the closer it approached the larger the orb appeared. I don\u2019t think the orb actually expanded, it just appeared larger, as perhaps an approaching car moving in ones direction would appear as it drew closer. The object wasn\u2019t that far away. The orb grew in size until features became visible.  It was clearly NOT a helicopter. There was no propeller, and no body of a craft of any kind visible at this point. The craft made no sound AT ALL during the entire observation. The apparent size of the object from our position was a little smaller than a dime held at arm\u2019s length, and appeared to be about 1000 to 1500 feet in elevation. The entire orb was orange, but down the center of the orb was a straight and solid \u2018semi-wide line\u2019 of solid orange light that was somewhat brighter than the rest of the orb. It was easily seen.  It extended all the way across the orb, except for the center, from one edge to the other. It essentially split the orb in two. The axis of the solid orange \u2018line\u2019 pointed in the same direction the orb was travelling.  The \u2018line\u2019 did not have a sharp edge but quickly blended into the light orange on either side of it. The circular outer edge of the entire orb was also a little brighter but not quite as bright as the \u2018semi-thick line\u2019. It did not have a sharp edge, and quickly blended into the lighter orange as well      At the center of the orb, between the solid \u2018lines\u2019 was a pulsing light (not blinking). It was not a sharp point of light. It could also be described more accurately as a throbbing light.  It was orange in color and pulsing-throbbing dimmer and brighter, dimmer and brighter at a steady and even rate of about 2 \u00bd pulses per second. The solid orange \u2018line\u2019 described two paragraphs ago came close to the edges of the pulsing light at the center, but didn\u2019t appear to connect to it. The pulsing center light was separate and pulsed on its own. The orb was travelling in a path that would take it directly overhead. At about 80 degrees overhead it started to slow down, gradually and very smoothly. The other witness who was also observing the slow down stated\u2026 To paraphrase\u2026 It\u2019s slowing down to look at you!... I felt the same!! This was a little concerning, and almost spooky for both of us. The orb only slowed down but did not stop. I estimate it slowed down by 25-30%. I don\u2019t recall it regaining its previous speed, but it may have. 5 to 10 seconds after noticing the orb slowing down and passing in the area overhead, the lighted orb began to turn off and on at random on either side of the pulsing center light and solid orange colored axis \u2018line\u2019. The throbbing center light did NOT turn off and continued to pulse unchanged.  The axis \u2018line\u2019 of solid orange light on either side of the pulsing center light remained lighted and unchanged most of the time, but flickered a few times and sometimes fragmented into separate distorted pieces of light, then reformed very quickly.  The random turning off and on of light on both sides of the orb occurred more often than the fluctuations of light on the center axis \u2018line\u2019. When in the area directly overhead,  ALL of the lights on the orb suddenly blinked off and the object tuned completely dark.  They did not turn back on even for a moment for the rest of the observation. After all the lights on the orb blinked off, a solid dark shape remained that is best described as a distorted square with uneven rounded corners. The distorted square appeared to remain the same size or very close to the same size as the orb when it was lighted.  It continued moving at the same smooth speed.  It was dusk and the sun was down but the sky was light blue and clear at our observation site and objects could easily be observed against the background sky. After a few seconds the dark distorted square changed shape into a round disc. This occurred while the object was directly or nearly directly overhead and moving away. The disc remained dark and continued to move smoothly toward the NNW. Because of its changing angle as it moved toward the horizon it became apparent it was a flat disc. I watched carefully to see if ANY type of lighting reappeared. None did. I observed the dark disc as it smoothly cruised in a straight line toward the horizon until the line of sight approached a row of trees about 250 yards away. Because of the dark, brownish black color of the object after the orange lights blinked off , it would have been impossible or nearly impossible to spot the distorted square or disc in a dark sky. The light blue background of dusk is probably the only reason we could observe it.","598":"15 second sighting of 2 ufo\u2019s in Walton, NY by 4 friends. I was having dinner and saw the two ufo\u2019s immediately over the mountain across The Valley around Dunk hill.  I immediately told my friend about the phenomena, because when I first saw it it was so unusual looking, that I could not mistake it for something else but an ufo. We saw them first coming towards us   They probably came around half a mile if our location.  When all of us starting to look at the ufo\u2019s they started first going backwards towards the east and then with an incredible speed into the stratosphere that we could only see the fireball faintly, and then disappearing in a second totally.

I was having a conversation with someone outside and I saw three bright light in the sky that was line up straight from the top to bottom.  And did not move or any flashing until I saw one that made a tear drop that caught my attention because I thought it was a shooting star, but it wasn\u2019t it\u2019s like a teardrop then the three bright light made a triangle shape and it was a perfect shape!  I was recording it and it was at night.  I thought it might be a drone or fireworks but it wasn\u2019t that.  I couldn\u2019t explain but we all saw that and i couldn\u2019t explain how it works or what it could be.","600":"5 large round bright orange objects appeared one by one in sky close to fireworks hovered silently for a minute and a half On July 4th, 2019, at approximately 2202, from my home in Bernalillo, NM, a half mile west of interstate 25, looking to the south SW approximately 12 miles to the Albuquerque Balloon Park.   I was watching the fireworks show that had been going on for about 15 minutes when I noticed out of my left peripheral vision a large bright orange round-except the bottom was flat-horizontal-object that was descending and heading south along the interstate at a very high rate of speed with absolutely no sound when it made a right hand \"fishhook\" 180` turn to the north and came to a sudden stop directly east and parallel to the fireworks and appeared to be a couple thousand feet above the fireworks, just north and west of the Sandia National Lab complex and Kirkland air base. When object 1 came to a stop and hover, a second object of the same size and color appeared to slide out from behind object 1, sliding to the west towards the fireworks.  The two objects hovered for about 30 seconds and started to come north towards my location. When the two objects started to move north three more objects of the same description and slightly lower than the two original objects, one right after the other like you turned on a light and they hovered in place. As object 1 and object 2 were heading north at about half the distance between my location and the other three objects, object 1 had started to get ahead of object 2 and made an immediate right hand 90` turn with out sound, towards the Sandia mountains, just south of the radio towers on top of the mountains and shot over the mountains in a 45` degree climb on the horizon and disappeared in 3 seconds.  When object one disappeared object two started to make the same right-hand turn and it then just disappeared. When objects 1 and 2 disappeared objects 3,4 and 5 hovered in place for approximately 20 additional seconds and one by one in the order they appeared disappeared as if you turned them off. This whole event took place within approximately two minutes starting at 2202 and ending at 2204.  The night sky was high thin overcast with 20 plus mile visibility, winds calm at the time.  No other objects\/aircraft or airships were observed during this timeline of event. At 2202 on my android phone I started rerecording this event for 27 seconds.  That\u2019s when I went to get my houseguest ((male's name deleted)) to witness it.  When we returned approximately 20 seconds later I started to record the event again as my phone was flashing Rec and this recording went on for about 1.5 minutes.  After the event we went into the house to see the videos and for some reason the second recording was not logged on my phone.  I do have the initial recording of 27 seconds, in which you can see the first object, see and hear the fireworks in the background lower right.  I will attach that video to this e-mail for your review. I have been in aviation my entire 30 plus year carrier in the Airmedical\/airevac field as an operations director for medical flight programs in Ohio and Florida.  I am a private pilot now with hundreds of flight hours with many hours IFR and in ICM conditions.  I served in the US Navy for six years starting in 1984 on the USS Lexington and USS Enterprise CVN-65 as an airman responsible for launch and recovery of aircrafts. I have also been a Paramedic for most of that time and now am a semi-retired airmedical consultant.  I can affirm in my 30 plus years in aviation, I have never witnessed anything such as this event and cannot rationalize what I saw that evening. Should you or anyone from your office wish to contact me please feel free to do so at the number listed below. Thank you for your time and interest in my observation.","601":"UFOs Spotted  05\/2019..  Color changed suspended in Air Good Evening All,  Just around 21:17 pm four of my sons we outside in front of the house hanging out talking.  My oldest, 26, noticed a very bright light in the sky, and out of curiosity, he asked, \u201cWhay is that?\u201d... they other theee boys. 19, 13, and 8, looked up in the sky to see what he was referring to.  Then all of a sudden, the craft changed into a red glow.  Moved swiftly at a 90 degree angel.  Made a brief stop next to another shining light which we are guessing it was another craft, then shot straight up in the air.  My sons started running into the house, my 8 and 13 year olds were screaming\u201d,  MOMMY THERE\u2019S A UFO OUT THERE RIGHT NOW!!!! \u201c I ran down the stairs and out the door but it had already vanished into the sky.  There were times before we heard strange noises outside in the late nights, and I also seen a huge white owl atop my post one morning when I was watching my son wait for the school bus to come and I yelled out to him to look at he looked up and seen the owl and started runnin! g back up the driveway.  Then the owl kinda soared over to a rooftop across the road and he looked at us.  I was in such disbelief, I was frozen and scared, I felt like it was not even real.  I had not ever seen any bird that huge and he was Snow White with black eyes. At the same time, he truly was the most beautiful and the most elegant creature I had ever seen in my life.   Thank You all for your ability and efforts to educate and discover.  Have a wonderful night.","602":"Very bright light moving northeast over our home.  The object did not have any flashing lights and was ten times brighter than the North Star.

Every morning between 1:00 am and 4:00 AM I go outside in my back yard with my two Rat Terriers to let them water the lawn.  On this particular morning, I was looking up at the southern sky and noticed what I thought was a rather bright looking star, but as I stared at it, I realized that it was very slowly drifting to the south.  After observing it for about one to two minutes tops, the light just simply shut off and this drifting star went completely dark as if someone shut off a light switch.  The sky in my area was cloudless on that particular morning at approximately 3:00 am.  Not sure what it was, but I am sure that it wasn't swamp gas.","610":"Large bright light appeared and dropped vertically at a tremendous speed. A very large bright light appeared in the sky, just over the tree line.  Object then dropped straight down, still bright enough to appear through the foliage before disappearing.","611":"Very fast rising, brilliant bronze, white, polished aluminum, straight trajectory East, disappearing in far distance and ultra height c Odd, Very Fast Flying, Climbing, flashing Against Sun, Disappearing in Apparent 100,000 Ft+ clouds  During Aprox. 60-90 second Period  From my vantage point on the rise East of Marysville, with view of the South end of Whidbey Island, the ferries crossing between Clinton and Mukilteo and the middle Olympic Mountains West, South-West of Quilcene and Poulsbo, and facing East, the tops of Mt. Pikchuck and beyond, I spotted a very, very fast-rising, very brilliant flashing craft. The sun was high, aprox. at 2 PM.  During the rise, which started above the highest Olympic peak - I see all the highest peaks - I attributed the  flashes to sun reflections as the sky was lightly clouded with mostly wispy, very high cover with widely-scattered denser, small cloud groups to the East. This craft appeared at first to be on a collision trajectory with a large, twin engine Boeing, dusty blue fuselage, white wings apparently on the test range route, North, from Paine Field, at approx. 5000 Ft.  However this craft passed nearly directly above the Boeing plane, perhaps 3 - 7000 Ft higher. It continued in a straight trajectory East, rising very fast, flashing brilliant bronze, blinding white, and polished aluminum, as if a multi, flat-sided, spinning shape reflected sunlight, or its own powerful, pulsed light that apparently covered the entire structure. On an apparent constant straight climb angle, it was entering the group of denser clouds to the East over the Cascades, I estimate 60, 000 Ft+ altitude. Apperaing to pass through lower clouds, as the flashes and now very small-appearing craft disappeared-reappeared between clouds, the flashing and color continued.  At this point I was barely able to discern the craft, except the brilliant flashing continued. However high, it was still on the 35 - 45 degree climb trajectory as it became too small against the moderately blue sky to the East of the clouds it went through. It was happening so fast I didn't think to check my phone for time.  I estimate the E.T. to be aprox. 60 - 90 seconds. Served in the Navy and watching Navy Aircraft, as a speed reference, this craft was not particularly much faster than full throttle fighter planes.  However, I imagine they would be sorely taxed to catch or intercept, or reach ATA strike velocity. The most remarkable feature was the brilliant, multi metallic colored flashing that covered the entire craft every flash. As this event was a weekday and I'm retired, and I figured the very brief elapsed time and trajectory would likely preclude all, if anyone else observing this with a similar vantage,  I didn't search for any place to share my experience.  Therefore, all I recall about the date is mid-May. This morning I checked for any search record of this siting.  This site came up.  I was unaware it exists, and am sharing this now.","612":"I was in the red ligth in Morton, when my eyes capture a white object flying low, but very fast moving,  After I saw that, I saw another one moving to the same direction.  I could fallow it because of the houses and the trees :( but it was something new for me.","613":"Yellow orange, large, oval lights faded in and out over about three minutes. One very bright, large, oval, orange yellow light faded in and stayed for about 10 seconds then faded out.   About 2 minutes later, three faded in in consecutive order, then faded out consecutively in about ten seconds in a vaguely triangular formation.  They were in the Southwest sky. Observers are not really into UFOs and were just sitting outside chatting.   One is a retired tattoo artist the other is a repossession specialist.","614":"Red sphere hovering low on our street Red Sphere hovering at about the height of the base of the roof on the house it waas nearest.  My husband and I were walking the dog and as we went over a small hill it was there hovering in the middle of the street,  It looked like it was only a few houses away from us. From where we stood it appeared about 2 ft wide maybe?  It was hard to tell.  It was a bright red, glowing sphere.  This street is well lit, so it was easy to tell that it was hovering all alone with nothing attached to it from any direction. It made no sound.  We got nervous and headed the other direction, looked over our shoulders, and it had disappeared completely.  The entire sighting lasted only a few minutes.","615":"Large bright light that became stationary and then moved at a very high rate of speed (many times faster than a plane).

My wife thinks that there was a red light next to the white light.  After 15 to 20 seconds, it made a left turn and traveled Northeast at a high speed  (fifty times faster than a commercial jet and disappeared  There was no sound.","616":"Morphing Ambient Glowing Cloud Sky Ghost I pulled up home way later than I thought from checking out the place I\u2019m moving into in a week, as I was driving up downtown from a street exit up 15th st I noticed this small tiny bread crumb shape looking glowing cloudish thing right over the moon..  As I was driving I kept an eye on it because it just seemed so out of place.  No other clouds around like it except maybe more on the horizon.  What caught my eye is that it was changing shape, almost dancing in a very graceful way around the top of the moon.  I\u2019m not religious but I could say it looked like a huge angel.  I have seen insane ufos in a huge group in Ohio and this was probably even more weird than that.  It wasn\u2019t a solid \u201ccraft\u201d or \u201cvessel\u201d of any sort but something that could be literally not of this physical world.

I\u2019m not on anything, I saw th! is completely sober.  I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.  I did some digging and I found the closest thing to what I saw tonight on YouTube , which I was actually surprised.  We really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on up there.   Here\u2019s the video I found closest thing to what I saw: https:\/\/youtu.be\/lM7aEI-_l0g","617":"Large Structure Class UFO with \"Drone\/Repair\" Class UFO. Large ufo structure class sighting.  Additional drone type ufo doing repairs along edges of large structure.  In the space where the large structure sat, there was a clearly definable dark, very dark area, which was extremely distinguishable from the sky which was starting to get lighter by the minute due to the sun rising.  There is no possibility that it was a cloud, it was precise and had an exact shape.  I couldn't take an adequate picture, but I drew a picture of the approximate shape.  If it weren't buried In a pile of old files, I would post it.   However, the large structure wasn't the only thing that convinced me it had to be an alien origin.  In the center of the larger object it appeared a set of lights began moving to possibly open up a what I would assume to be a hangar type area?  And then a light appeared and began moving along the outer edges of the overall object very precisely.  Moving most likely at hundreds of miles an hour.  It would stop every so often and \"light up\" the area it looked as though it was repairing the hull of something for only fractions of a second to a second or two at most.  Every so often it would move much quicker between what I would call \" apparent repair points\" and changed directions as it went along the structure multiple times, with very precise movements.  The overall structure took up about 1\/4-1\/3 of the sky that was visible within our eyesight and leaning back to see as much as we could.  My girlfriend and stone cold sober roommate witnessed in addition to myself.  I probably should have posted this much earlier but I have been skeptical of what I saw considering how crazy it was.  Also have been searching for any account of an identical sighting.  I've never seen anything like this before and this is coming from someone who has seen a dozen different ufos with a dozen different people.  It made me feel incredibly small.  To anyone who doesn't believe this story, that's up to you.  But trust me I know what we saw and I am only posting this in hopes of creating a better account of sightings such as this. I probably could add more detail and try to make this post more legit seeking but that's again not my point. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))","618":"I saw a bright-white orb appear (clear sky), travel 5 sec.parallel to the east coastline heading N, then disappear. It was the early morning hours of September 13th, and the last day of a three day meteor shower.  I often enjoy these events and didn\u2019t want to miss the last morning of the event.  I got up and went outside with a pillow to lie down on our bench to get a good general view of the sky before the sunrise.  My feet were facing south, my left shoulder to the east coast (the sun was beginning to rise a bit). I caught the first meteor in the upper right quadrant of view\u2026. It was orange in color and zipped the usual speed (1\/4-1\/2 second in length).  A few minutes later I saw the second\u2026in the bottom left quadrant\u2026.same seed.  It was bright white in color.  I then noticed an airplane\u2026flashing lights in the right, middle area of my general sight.  It was going the usual speed\u2026.and quite a bit slower in speed as the meteors\u2026.I do not recall if I heard it. Then (at the same time as the plane was flying from right to left in the middle of my vision), all of a sudden a white orb appeared to the left of mid-field.... out of nowhere.  It was a circle\/ball of light\u2026.opaque in substance as best as I could tell with my eyes.  There were no clouds in the sky (except a long thin one that was at the bottom of my field of sight).  The orb was quite a bit larger than the meteors\u2026..about the size of a red light when you are stopped about 4 cars back.  Best I could tell it was way over the tree line but below the height of the airplane.  It traveled south to north for about 5 full seconds and then just disappeared.  It was traveling at least 4 times as fast as the airplane, but at least 4 times slower than the meteors.  It didn\u2019t waver; there was no sound; no pulsing; it followed a straight line\u2026.and just\u2026was gone.  I have never seen anything like it and I am an avid sky-watcher.  Whatever it was\u2026it seemed to follow the coastline.","619":"MADAR Node 154","620":"One airliner sized teardrop object, hovering vertically near city.

I saw what I thought was a plane going by and was staring at it thinking how much it would suck to be stuck way up there while the lightening was this bad.  It had red and green lights with no particular flashing pattern then I realized it wasn\u2019t moving and appeared circular.  it was just flying there and the second I thought this, the lights turned red and it moved to the right then the lights alternated and it moves down a bit.   I yelled for my husband because I\u2019d never seen anything move like that- it\u2019s way to too high in the sky and far away to be a helicopter.  Then, it moved down really quickly while blinking green lights only and very rapidly, faster than it had at all before.  It moved so fast down while blinking that it almost looked like it split into multiple vehicles for a second or left a trail of green lights really briefly.  Then, it looked as it if disappeared out of my sight like zoomed too far away to see while moving \u201cdown\u201d.  It was really unnatural movement and in the middle of a lightening storm with no thunder.

Had contacted you in April last year, 2018, regarding a strange spider like craft, or more like a surveillance entity with an opaque oval nucleus, and 8-12 wavy wire- like legs, darker than nucleus, with each having a black 1-2 cm disk on the ends. This thing scampered across ceiling and disappeared into the wall where ceiling and wall converge. I gave a time for the 7\/5\/19 incident, but was not by my phone or a clock.  I\u2019d guess it was around 1-3 am since it was totally dark outside.  No lights or tv was on inside.

On the evening of July 6, 2019, at around 1800 hours, I was doing a photoshoot with a model on the roof of a hotel in Coralville, Iowa.  I was primarily shooting to the northwest with a partly cloudy sky.  The goal of the shoot was to get the model with a nice cloudy background in the shots.   When I arrived home in Des Moines, Iowa, the next day, I noticed an unusual object on one of the frames.  As I began to look at more frames, I noticed the object was moving throughout several of the images.  I also noticed the object had a companion.  Both objects interacted with the clouds at their base.  For the most part, the objects were circular, but in the first few frames one of the objects had an oval shape with a pyramid shape within the oval.  Neither I, or the model, noticed the objects during the shoot.  I have enclosed a pdf file with several slides detailing the event.","627":"Saucer shaped object descended and hovered above tree lines.  Not sure if it left or landed.

Object  did not make sound as far as I know but our dogs were absolutely losing it.  Stuck in awe.  By the time we reached to record the object, it made sporadic movements forward\/ backward\/side\/side but then appeared as if it just vanished.

He was pulling the leash and seemed to be trying to track something down with intensity.  We went around a corner, and a huge bright light became visible in the sky.  Once we were paying attention to it he seemed to calm down. This light was far bigger than any star in the sky, and moved smoothly and seemed to meander around as it moved towards the direction of Belt, the movement reminded me more of a life form than an aircraft.  It was so bright it was difficult to distinguish a shape, but it may have been diamond shaped or triangular.  It eventually disappeared behind some trees and we were unable to find it again as we walked around. We also noticed a few other lights moving in a similar fashion, but they were much further up and were much smaller from our observation point.  There were also 2 shooting stars while we observed. We are located very close to Malmstrom AFB.  I watched one of the smaller ones from our back yard for another 2 minutes after we returned, and it eventually just disappeared.

I was driving home from Wilkes-Barre to the Philadelphia area late at night, with the sighting occurring at approximately 1:15 am on Wednesday morning.  Immediately after exiting the Lehigh Tunnel, roughly in-between the Jim Thorpe\/Mahoning Valley and Allentwon exists, I noticed two white lights to my right.  They appeared to be about 30 ft apart, and the left one was blinking about every other second while the right light was solid. I was engrossed in a podcast at the time I first noticed the lights, and thought oh it\u2019s just some plane.   However after about 10 seconds past the tunnel exit, when the glare from the lights of the tunnel exit were fading away, I looked back at the object in confusion.  Why is this plane flying so low?  It was right at the tree line, less than 200 ft from the ground.  Why does this aircraft seem to be flying slow enough for me to nearly keep up with it?  Why is there only one blinking white light and while the other one was remaining solid?  As I was able to see the object more and more clearly, I noticed the two lights appeared to be at the rear corners of a silhouette of an equilateral triangle, with the tip of the triangle (again relative to the aircraft\u2019s trajectory) having no light emanating from it.  It was bizarrely black.  Like the blackest black I\u2019ve ever seen.  It literally blended in with the night sky almost too well for me to make out a shape.  And then I noticed in the middle of the bottom of the aircraft, there was this dim glowing dark red\/orange circle (it reminded me of the glow from the last ember of a dying campfire), that looked like it had some kind of hatch over it.  At this point the craft began moving over the highway and to the left, still shockingly low in the sky, and it was beginning to slow down.  Still barley in front of me at the same height, I noticed a bright light shooting up vertically from what seemed like a random spot in the forest next to the highway.  The craft appeared to be heading for this light, as it had slowed down and then halted one it reached it.  As I passed by, trying to go slowly as acceptably possible on the highway, still seeing it hovering over the light, I lost it in my rear view mirrors after a few seconds.  It hadn\u2019t dawned on me until a minute or two after the sighting that I thought to myself, why the heck didn\u2019t that thing make any noise?  At its altitude, if it was any kind of traditional aircraft, it should have been VERY loud especially considering how close I was to it.  From start to finish of viewing the aircraft, it was as silent as if there was nothing there at all. I consider myself an amateur astronomer as I frequently take my telescopes out at night in my suburban Philadelphia backyard or elsewhere for viewing the night sky.  Only 30 minutes (or less depending on the time and day) from the Philadelphia International Airport, I have seen every type of passenger aircraft that frequent the airport flying to and from it, at all sorts of heights and perspectives, and I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like this.  (I actually have seen a similar bizarrely noiseless totally black V shaped aircraft flying at low altitude a couple years ago in my backyard, but that is not what this report is about.)  I would do anything to get in touch with the one or two other cars on the turnpike near me at the time of the sighting for verification that I\u2019m not nuts.  If you guys received any calls or anything regarding an aircraft of similar description that same night, I would really appreciate knowing.","636":"Saw a vertical rectangle, looked like a lower case letter i, move across the sky.  Daytime - no lights on object. Stepped out of my garage and over the neighbors trees I saw a rectangular object moving across the sky.  It caught my eye because it looked almost like a lower case I moving over the trees.  Appeared to be heading in a south\/southwesterly direction and seemed to be 1\/4 to 1\/2 mile away.  Had my 14 year old daughter come out because it looked so weird and neither of us could figure out what it was.  Watched it continue on until it was hidden behind trees.  Neither of us had our phones to take a picture.  It was still pretty light outside.  Didn't see any lights on the object.","637":"White\/grey Disk UFO seen Floating above Edmonton Hi, I am reporting my sighting of a half visible UFO object which seemed to look white on the bottom, and very light shade of grey towards the top.\t I had noticed it while biking. There is no lie when it comes to me explaining to people about my sightings. \t A fact for you to know is that I spotted it twice, the most recent one was 20 minutes ago, 8:15PM.  It disappeared so I can not prove it no matter how much I want to.  What i can do is add an image that looks identical to my sightings. It will not look exactly the same.  It was higher into the sky, and not as dark coloured.  More out in the distant I would say.","638":"Fixed position of multi color blinking light cluster.  That recede into distance and out of my sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

When it took off it turned into a large red ball and was gone in about 3 seconds.  I couldn\u2019t believe it,  I kept looking at the sky and about 1 minus after the triangle took off, 3 more huge red balls shot from north to south and were visible about 3 seconds. Now there are 2 jets that just came into the airport and 3 military choppers.  I hear them as I\u2019m writing this.  One chopper went below the tree line where the 1st red ball fell.  I came in to write this and I\u2019m going back out to watch. I just came back inside and the choppers are still flying around.  It is now almost Midnight","640":"I saw 2 pearlescent-yellow\/orange lights traveling together like helicopters but without the noise. I went to let the dogs outside before going to bed.  The moon was full & bright in the eastern sky and when I turned and looked in the western sky, I thought I saw 2 planes coming, but realized they were not flashing lights like a plane does, and had a very pearlescent or yellowish glow that you don\u2019t see on regular planes.  They moved quickly through the sky but stayed in formation with each other and the thing that struck me most strange, was how quiet it was.

We thought we saw a plane, but then realized the craft was still and blinking red and blue.  It was a circular shape and sat for a good 5 seconds but then shot up super fast and  disappeared   In the trees.  We sat and looked at each other for a minute a freak end and went inside it was freaky.","642":"Glowing lights above Kent CT at 1:00 am 05\/21\/19 Copy of Several UFOs filmed on my camera.  Approximately 12:55 am on 5\/21\/19, I was almost asleep in bed when I heard Canada geese Flying above.  Wondered why they were out at the time.  Sat by my window and looked toward Kent School which is a half block from the residence.  Grabbed my camera and started filming.  First time I actually got it on my camera!!!  One on right kept disappearing and reappearing.  Filmed 2.5 minutes.","643":"triangular shaped object, with very bright white lights covering each wing took my dog into the garden.  after about 2 minutes, noticed an object in the clear sky above (full moon, and a few stars)  I first thought the object was a satellite moving above me travelling at speed from north to east, around 5 thousand feet above (approx) the object appeared to be of a triangular shape like this \">\" with white lights across both the lines (wings?) very bright.  I do not believe it to be a plane.  there was complete silence, and an eerie feeling watching it.  i went back inside to get my phone to try and get footage but had gone right into the distance when i returned with the phone.  am kicking myself i didn't get film of it.","644":"Flashes of white light followed by non-periodic, lesser intensity orange &quot;burning&quot; lights of longer duration. Was outside on back porch.  Light caught my attention by flashing bright white, point-source.  Flash was brighter than any star or satellite I have seen previously.  Light was approximately 80 degrees above the horizon relative to my position.  After the initial bright, white flash there were subsequent flashes as the lights moved slowly to the north.   The odd thing was there was no periodicity to the flashes; they were random in time during the 5 minute observation.  between each bright flash were less bright, almost orange \"burning\" flashes.  They seemed to intensify then sort of \"burn out\".   Very strange and very high in the sky.  I have been a casual observer of meteors and fireballs, but this was none of those.  After watching for a few minutes there were no more flashes.","645":"Mysterious & Beautiful Bright White Lights. I work the midnight shift, and I happen to look up into the sky (facing north) just below the handle of the big dipper (ursa major) I saw what looked like a comet.  It was a big bright white light as bright as the moon was last night.   Then in an instant it went from one to four balls of light falling kind of in a check mark shape, and as quickly as it appeared, it was gone.   I've tried to search and even posted to social media to see if anyone else saw this, of course most people I know are in bed at that time.  I wish it would have lasted long enough to get capture footage.  It was beautiful what ever it was.","646":"The Moon, Jupiter and a UFO in Florida\u2019s night sky. My dogs woke me at early this morning to go outside (barking).  I let them out and stood by the open door waiting for them sleepily.  I gazed up at the bright beautiful moon and noticed Jupiter lower and toward what would be my right,  but then (also lower and what would be my right) there was another bright object.  This object I wondered if was a planet surely would be big news of such an alignment.  So I watched the sky for a bit and noticed it blinking different colors and moving in strange ways.  Up and down (from my vantage point) and side to side and sometimes a little ways up then side ways, down then jumping back to original location.  Kind of all over the place within a (what seemed from my distance) to be a relatively small area.  It was very high up and close to Jupiter.  I did not feel fear, but wonderment.   I grabbed my cheap little cell phone to try capturing it on video (mostly to probe to myself I wasn\u2019t imaging things.   It was a long vid o! f me trying to focus mostly but I did indeed capture it for a few seconds.  On a side note:  I know the tall whites exist (not saying they have anything to do with this sighting), BUT I have seen one.  I saw it shift from it\u2019s original tall lanky graceful body (walking) to a teenage girl (walking with another teenage girl).  The feeling I got was that this being was there to assist her in some way.  It projected a peaceful and caring spirit (if you will).  This happened about four years ago in San Diego, CA.   Now I know for sure UFOs exist.","647":"4 lights spinning over the street in front of my house I just got home from my job at McDonalds around 11:00pm, a few hours of me playing video games my mom called me outside to the front porch and asked me if I see those lights, I tell her yeah.  My mom proceeds to ask me what do you think they are?  I say honestly there's no big buildings around so they're not lights for planes to see, no one owns any lights strong enough to shoot into the sky, at least not without a beam of light shooting from the ground.   I then said and there's no new things opening, so they aren't ad lights,  I then said well I can't see the shape because its ehind the clounds but i could see the lights. I think it was a spinning stiangle.  I say this because there were 3 cirles next to each other like this ooo then there was one underneath that, and it was spinning as well so like this.   o This thing had to be at least 200ft wide because the rotation of the lights went from up 2 streets down in front of my house to all the way up my street, the lights stayed there for some time until i got tired and went back inside.  I tried to record it but my phone didn't pick up the faint light because of the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My husband and I observed this and taped it for a few minutes.  We have seen this on other days in the fields on the opposite side of my house as well.  It sometimes has a red flash of light and then disappears.","649":"What was in the sky this morning? I saw a very bright light, strange irregular shape but mostly vertical orientation.  No blinking, moving south then disappeared from view after about 15 seconds.  About 30 seconds later I saw it again, this time much farther south and dimmer, then it disappeared completely.  At least one aircraft also seen in the sky at the time.","650":"I was on S. Miller Ave. and S.W.61st St. walking north.  The UFO heading West toward Will Rogers World Airport.  I heard a helicopter, so I looked up .  When I did I saw that the helicopter was flying higher than they usually do.  I noticed a flash go past the helicopter. That's when I saw a ball or sphere.  They were going in opposite directions.  Like if to be playing a game of chicken.  As it passed, the sphere looked to be close enough to gauge a measurement.  From what I could guess it looked to be half the size or just a tad smaller than that to the cab of the helicopter.  This is your standard size the police and news use.  I watched as the helicopter would fly in a circle keeping up with but keeping a far distance . Huge circles what might be 2 mile circles. stay high really high up.  The sphere was fling slow and it seemed to spin.  I say that because the sun would reflect off of it in increments.","651":"Slow to then stop moving flying object to slow movement again. Towards dusk thought I saw a plane but this object was slowly moving and then came to what appeared a stop then began moving at a slow speed again...there were no blinking lights. It appeared as tho it was moving with the sun for reflection to mislead but was definitely not an aircraft I had ever seen due to the unusual flight pattern....do airplanes fly at such a slow seeps with no identifiable markers no lights...

On 08\/14\/19 at about 7:00 pm, I saw what looked like a plane with no wings flying North, kind of low in the sky.  About the height a propeller plane would fly (below cloud height).  I didn\u2019t see any lights and the object looked to be pure white and the length of any commercial plane. It did not have a vapor trail and I saw it through tree tops so it disappeared from my view very quickly.  I thought it was a jet at first but what caught my attention was that it was so low for this area.  There is no commercial airport nearby.  I quickly realized it had no wings and was just a cylinder or cigar shape.  I heard nothing which I thought was strange based on the height it was flying . As soon as it flew behind some leaves (about 4-5 seconds after I first saw it), I ran around the trees to a wide open area to make sure of what I was seeing.  Maybe 25 feet on the ground and then there was nothing blocking my view.  It only took maybe another 3 or 4 seconds to get to the clear area.  I was shocked that it was gone.  Nothing at all in the sky.  No vapor trail.  It was way to far below the clouds to have gone behind them or into them. It was not traveling anywhere near fast enough to have disappeared.  I even waited a couple of minutes to see if I was missing something.   I have no idea where it went and the fact that it disappeared like that is why I am looking into this further. I went online to see if anyone else saw it and that is how I came upon this website,  I would really like to find out more information and see if anyone else saw this or something of a similar circumstance?  I\u2019m pretty skeptical about these things, but I am very confused about what this could have been?  I know for sure I saw the object. It could see how I could possibly misidentify an object but I could not have misplaced it in that time frame.","653":"Ball of light seen falling in Abbott, TX We are driving northbound on 35E in Abbott, TX.  Both my spouse and I saw an object fall from the sky.  It was a solid white ball of light, and the turned green for a brief moment.  After that it disappeared.  It was not a firework.

They were red and green balls of lights in the night's sky.  The green ones followed the red ones.  They were in a formation at one time, then separated and looked like they were starting to land.  But then they shot straight back up and disappeared.","655":"Craft rapidly goes side to side.  Appears to have 3 lights at triangle tips.

I was walking north on a street in Saint Clair Shores and stopped on the sidewalk for a reason I will not identify.  I was looking up at some trees.  Suddenly, an orb of white color or circle dropped nearly straight down.  I would estimate at about 250-260 degrees. The object then went unnoticed or disappeared.  It would have still been in my site but went dark.  There were 2 clouds above where it dropped from in my vision.  They went dark on an angle of me looking at the top of a telephone pole about 30 yards ahead of me.  I can not estimate the altitude before the drop. This is my 3rd sighting (just in this area) and I've lived in the area for a short time (exact time not to be given).  Selfridge Air Force Base is about a ten minute drive from here and is North as well. I have reported sightings in the past.  I think since I'm nocturnal (and outside at night) I run into these more often than most people.  This object did not drop at the speed I've seen others drop in my opinion.  Fast but not as fast.  Either that, or I'm speeding up. That's about it.  I saw one over Lake St. Clair a few months back dropping in a similar manner.  I didn't report that one.","657":"MADAR Node 116","658":"Wednesday July 10, 2019. Sisters, Oregon  At approximately 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM I stepped from my room to see a large vertically oriented  tube-like object.  I stood looking at it puzzled, before I captured the following images in my iPhone. I can only logically interpret what I witnessed it as a possible high altitude balloon, as the form would slightly change.  The top appeared to be solid and would at times glow (possible light reflection from the sun).  The middle section appeared amorphous,  The bottom\/lower segment also appeared to be solid and reflective or illuminated. However, I could not positively identify the aerial phenomenon.

On the evening of Jul 10, 2019, at 9:38 pm, I was in my yard, watering plants.  The news forecast was predicting possible thunder storms,  so I looked up to check the sky.  That\u2019s when I noticed the brilliant pink colors which I had never seen before.   The sun was just starting to go down. I grabbed my Samsung phone and took a total of 14 pictures of the sky with the brilliant bright pink colors.  I viewed the pictures approximately 10 minutes later as I wanted to upload the best one to Facebook.  I noticed a \u201cmark\u201d on one of the pictures.  When I zoomed in on the picture I knew this was not a scratch on my lens or an insect as there was a pink cloud in front of the object. At 9:55 pm I decided to send the picture through messenger to a local journalist here in Medicine Hat, Alberta. At 10:09 pm the pink sky was fading fast and the street lights were just beginning to turn on.   I thought I would take a few more pictures in the direction of where I took the first pictures.    The 4 pictures I took were a darker blue hue that still had some light pink clouds in the area where the unidentifiable object had been. When I think back,  I did not \u201chear\u201d any loud noises that would have caught my attention like an airplane.  I did not physically see the object until I viewed my pictures.  It had to be going very fast though as the picture before (213806) was about 7 seconds apart from (213814).  Up to this point I had assumed the vessel was travelling SW because the dome is on the right hand side.  However, if the dome is the front of the aircraft then it could have been travelling NE in which case there may be a slight object in the picture 213806 which was taken before picture 213814. The following day, Jul 11, 2019, at 12:34 pm, my pictures were uploaded to the Facebook page \u201cCommunity TV\u201d by the journalist.  (The original picture & the zoomed in picture).  There was a woman who confirmed seeing the object, which had no color and no wings (like an airplane). Today, Saturday Jul 13, 2019, I came across a website that had a similar picture of a siting which was dated Feb 22, 2019, on the following website:  https:\/\/mufoncms.com\/pubic_report\/ website.","660":"Glowing Gold\/Light Orb Seen In Sky for Split Second Was out around 1:00 AM that night.

It then stopped hovered for about few minutes moving up and down, at one point it seem to \"shimmy\" or change shape but not any larger.  It then moved up at 45: angle and disappeared.  I do not have any footage as at first it did not seem strange only when moved upward and disappeared that I realized it may have been a UFO.  If it is a government experimental craft it very sophisticated.","663":"I was just cleaning up and coming inside from having a fire.  And I looked up at the moon and just to the right of it there were 3 lights in a straight line moving from west to east crossing infront of my view of the moon.  These lights did not look like any aircraft I've seen, it did not have any blinking lights and it was moving considerably faster then the airplanes I typically see overhead.  These lights were also really bright and from what I was seeing the lights had almost a bluish green tint to them.  The whole thing lasted only a few minutes and they were out of view.  Certainly peaked my interest!","664":"I was outside bbq.  When I observed in the direction of lower lake a ball in the sky very bright.  That did not move.

It was very a dark, mainly clear, night making it very easy to see the stars.  Being an avid stargazer, I looked up to the sky to watch the stars pass by.  To the southwest from the passengers front seat I saw a strange bright orange light in the sky hovering around the moon.  I immediately noticed that this light was not a star or planet and did not seem to be any aerial craft that I am familiar with.  There was no explanation as to how this object was staying in the sky because i did not see a jet trail or fire coming from anywhere on the object.  I began to get an uneasy feeling in my stomach.  As I watched the object, the light elongated into an oblong shape, still showing the same orange light. \tI watched the object morph back and forth between the orb and the oblong shape for about 15 min in the clear sky.  Suddenly clouds appeared covering the area where the moon and the object both were.  Through the clouds you could still see the light of the object shining very brightly.  I watched the light change color from orange to white and begin blinking in and out from behind the clouds as a strobe light would.  After about 3-5 minutes the light completely disappeared followed by the dissipation of the clouds where the moon was back out but nothing was around it.  I continued to glance at the sky for the next few minutes and the object suddenly appeared again after about 5 minutes just as it had the first time. The object continued to morph back and forth between the orb and the oblong shape, shifting from side to side, while hovering. \tThe craft stayed around the moon either at the same level or dipping down just a bit below the moon's level.  I watched this for about 45 minutes then more clouds showed up between my view and the object, where it repeated the same process as before, then again disappeared.  When this happened the clouds followed suit dissipating, revealing the object had vanished once again.  After a few minutes the object returned again, where I continued to watch this process repeat, until around 1230 when I fell asleep in the car.  I could still see the object very vividly during the event as I passed through towns and cities with their bright lights against the night sky.  I saw a plane in a different area of the sky but both the plane and object stayed in separate areas of each other.  Since the incident I have had technical issues with my phone working such as touch screen not registering, apps opening themselves, and my battery draining faster.  I am thoroughly convinced I saw an extraterrestrial craft in the sky that night.","668":"Pulsating orange craft seen overhead from outside my apartment in north Bellingham, near the airport.  In fact, it was in approximately the same place in the sky that I saw a similar craft in December of 2013, though this one appeared to be at a higher altitude (or was smaller).  It was alternately hovering, then moving very slowly to the north.

To provide background, to the north of my apartment is a major thoroughfare of Aircraft flying West toward DFW Airport and Love Field in Dallas, TX.  I often smoke outside in the evenings and have seen all types of crafts, usually easily determining that they are Commercial Aircraft.  On THIS occasion, the light was different. First, the light was White and moved about half-way across the entire horizon from East to West.  It moved at a MUCH higher rate of speed than any plane.  There were planes in the distance to compare to.  Suddenly, it Stopped.  No slowing, as if a plane was turning\u2026 it just Stopped.  It proceeded to move directly Upward at a high rate of speed, and then back Downward at a slower rate.  This is definitely not any maneuver that can be performed by modern aircraft.  It was also quite a distance away.  My guess would be 10+ Miles North of me, possibly near McKinney, TX, but it is hard to determine . The light was Solid White to begin with, then began to flash, and then turned a solid Red.  The flashing was Extremely Bright for something that far away. I ran inside to get my Cell Phone to record the light.  When I came back out, the light was still there, and came above the horizon (so, it couldn\u2019t be a drone\u2026 too far away.)  It continued to flash and then moved directly Upward.  It then moved to the East toward an Airplane that was flying East to West.  It seemed to mirror the speed of the plane, but was lower on the horizon.  Again it stopped.  The color changed to a Red from White, and it dimmed by a large amount.  The Light then became bright again and moved back to the West.  I continued to watch the light until it went below the Horizon. I see planes flying in this sky on a DAILY basis\u2026 and always keep an eye out for anything weird\u2026 this is the FIRST TIME I have ever seen anything like this.  I don\u2019t know WHAT is was, but the movements were not something I had ever witnessed, nor do I believe that the maneuvers could have been completed by any craft with our technology. I DID video what I could, but my footage is grainy, and I\u2019m not a good Camera-Man.  I do narrate what I am seeing.

It had twinkling blue lights around it.  At first, the object was very still.  It then began to move through the sky slowly, traveling east, it would stop periodically over the span of 5 minutes or so.   All of a sudden, the object accelerated very quickly so we had to move to another area of our house to keep observing it.   Once we were at the other area of our home, we saw the object disappear behind some clouds in the sky.","676":"We saw 3 lights in a triangle shape.  They were pulsing and at one point they seem to stack on top of each other.  They seem to change color.","677":"2 objects moving extremely fast.

I was able to observe the light for a long period of time, even at extreme distances. No sound at all.  The lights seemed very far apart, especially for objects moving so fast.  Could have possibly been 4 separate objects.  But they stayed at a consistent distance","678":"Moving amber lights in the sky, disappearing and reappearing One amber light turned into three dots in the sky and then disappeared, reappeared and formed into a line of four dots, moved extremely fast in the sky to the left and then disappeared, than reappeared for a quick second and disappeared for good","679":"My husband and i live right next to the Halifax River and approximately a mile from the Granada Bridge.  There are several park benches along a pathway beside the river across from our house, and we walked over there this evening to have a break and to enjoy the evening in the night skies.  And looking toward what would be the end of the Granada bridge going into A1A at the beach, we noticed three round lights they were spread pretty far apart from each other, and although all three lights are lit at one time, when one light would go off another one would come on, and then another one would go off and another one would come on.  It was just real slow and silent.  And it was in one position for a little while and then it went off completely, and then it was in a different position in another location just probably several feet from that one, and it was not running in a straight line.  And then it turn completely off for a bit, and then it showed back up again completely in another location & the lights kept doing that same thing.  And then they all went off again. And we didn't see it again after that.  And we walked back over to the house.  Not sure what we saw, but it was definitely not an airplane, because he was moving in an erratic pattern.  And it made no noise as it hovered what seemed like just you know maybe a mile above the building line.","680":"Low flying silent object with very bright flashing lights, rapid movements, not in a straight path-loops and circles (but almost as if surveillance).

I was in the park with my wife and daughter and laying on my back staring up the swallows flying high above. A small white dot caught my attention (a small star bright light) much higher than commercial airline flights seem to be and way higher than the swallows above. At first I thought nothing of it as it could be something reflecting light from the sun, but the object started to move to the left. After it moved it really caught my attention and a few seconds just stopped. After the obeject had stopped moving, two more lights (or star bright dots) appeared directly underneath the original object. It was in perfect vertical straight line underneath the original dot and totaled three lights. The three lights all proceeded to move left again and after a few seconds of following the dots\/stars I tried to alert my wife and point out the general direction.  In this time more had appeared sporadically (in no formation or visibly noticeable) formation.  The number grew till around 7 stars could be seen and spaces all over the area of sky.  The whole event lasted around 2 minutes and my wife (to my frustartition) didn\u2019t managed to track or witness it.  I\u2019m actually sad that I alone witnessed it and would have even tried to contact a complete stranger to highlight what I was witnessing!  I would honestly love to know if any sighting (other than mine) happened and up till yesterday would have literally laughed at anyone telling me they had witnessed something extra ordinary or a UFO. This really changed for me yesterday and tried in all ways to rantionalize and explain what it could have been, both civilian and military wise. Hope to hear from you back and all the best.","685":"green sphere with a glowing green streak behind it I was driving home from work I was almost to the train tracks in Lebanon Junction when I saw a big almost like a rock or something I didn\u2019t get a good look at it but it was green and it was huge and it had a streak following behind it almost like a neon green streak and it didn\u2019t go down towards the grown (sic.  Ground) it went across the sky but it started off slow and then took off really fast like I saw a quick glimpse of it and then it shot off it was the craziest thing I have ever seen I wish I could have seen it longer or at least stopped my car to see it better.

Moved extremely slow.  Then it went over my tree line and was gone.","687":"Huge bluish oval object with neon green crescent tip shot\/whistled from horizon almost a mile up in about 2 seconds and disappeared. The object shot up from the horizon at an extreme speed, almost whistling as it rose, leaving behind a thin smoke trail that glowed a faint white for about 5 seconds after the object disappeared,  I would personally say the object went about an honest mile into the air in about 2 seconds before it suddenly disappeared and almost got sucked into nothingness.  This object had a defined bright blue rectangular shape soaring with a neon-lime green cone-shaped tip.  This object was massive even in relation to its extreme distance from me and was also extremely bright and lit up the surrounding area with such brightness it was almost equal to a helicopter spotlight, but with a much larger radius shining on the ground.   Sent a true chill and tingle through my body as I was shaken to the core for a reason I could not explain.  Truly a once in a lifetime experience.","688":"Me and my girlfriend were outside stargazing for about 4 hours.  We immediately noticed there were an abnormal amount of planes in the sky, many being in very close proximity.  Around 11 o clock, I saw a white object appear out of nowhere and streak through the sky before  disappearing.  It happened again 15 minutes later, this time we both saw it.  We saw it two more times before we went inside.  Never seen anything like it.","689":"Purple orange cylinder over Richardson Bay 54 year old father driving with his four year old son south along Tiburon boulevard saw a bright red and orange cigar shaped object pass silently approximately 80 feet over his car.  The object looked to be about 24 feet long and 3 feet wide and was glowing violet or purple along its shaft and was brighter red-orange at the end, which appeared to be slightly wider than the rest of the cylinder.  The object moved in a straight diagonal path from the Tiburon peninsula at approximately the Hilarita neighborhood at  the level of the Saint Hilary School directly over Richardson Bay toward Sausalito and the Golden Gate Bridge. As the object passed over the 2016 Kia Sorento SUV, the satellite radio cut off for a second, the dashboard lights flickered and the motor lost acceleration. The father kept watching the object as long as possible but lost sight of the object over Richardson Bay.  He then proceeded to drive south along Tiburon Boulevard through downtown to the end of the peninsula between Tiburon and Angel Island where he looked for the object but saw nothing.  He waited at the parking lot across from the Caprice Restaurant for approximately three minutes watching the bridge lights of the Golden Gate Bridge with his young son while the car remained idling and parked with the the car windows down. Suddenly, there was an extremely strong downdraft of wind that moved the trees in different directions as well as a loud whooshing sound.  The father immediately closed the car windows and drove out of the lot, returning toward Tiburon downtown.  At this point, he realized the entire town was now dark and later learned that a blackout had occurred across most of the county that lasted more than an hour.","690":"2 bright lights above the mountains in Anchorage My window faces the Mountains just east of Anchorage.  My cousin and I looked outside and saw a really bright light above the mountains.  It shined for about 2 minutes.  It faded and then a second light appeared to the right of the first one.  This one only lasted for about a minute.  Then we looked around the sky and didn\u2019t see anything except for two airplanes in the South.  We have no idea what these lights were.

It appeared, zipped across the sky and then disappeared.  Certainly not a conventional aircraft.  I don't believe it was a comet or shooting star etc., I've seen many of those.

It was overcast around the moon and as I was looking at the moon an off white oval looking craft was flying faster than airplane.  I was curious because there were no con trials behind the craft.  I have seen satellites at night and this craft was traveling about as fast.  I watched it as it approached the clouds that were pretty high in elevation and the craft went behind them.  The cloud cover went as far as I could see so I did not see the craft after going behind the clouds.  The craft did change to a darker shade just before going behind the clouds so I though maybe it was going into the earth's shadow.  I certainly can say it was not the shape of any aircraft I have seen and that is why I am reporting it.  I pointed it out to my wife but she didn't see it.

I was in the trail parking lot near 494 after jogging when my son pointed at the sky and said, \u201cShooting star!  Make a wish.\u201d  I turned and saw a streak of light low in the sky, apparently moving fairly slow (I was briefly concerned it was heading in our direction).  It began shedding individual lights, which I thought might be a meteor breaking up.  Then the streak turned east and split up into 3-4 more lights that spread out and moved back and forth like helicopters circling something.  They all gradually descended and disappeared behind the tree-line. I watched for a couple of minutes, but nothing came back up.  I\u2019d estimate it was in the direction of Shokapee...distance was very difficult to determine because they were just lights in an otherwise clear sky. Anyway, weird event...the lights certainly didn\u2019t move in a familiar way, but there wasn\u2019t any good frame of reference.  Really curious what that was.

My neighbor, or former firefighter, was very startled and kept asking, \"What is that?\"  I said, \"it looks like large Japanese lanterns or maybe drones.  He said, \"It's not drones\".   In about 3 minutes, they flew upward and off together in formation into the distance (northeast toward Chesnee, SC) and out of sight.  We heard no sound.

I was sitting in bed at about 10:30-10:40pm.  I looked over at my husband to continue our conversation when I noticed a red blinking light out the window.  It was slowly moving upward.  After reaching a certain altitude it stopped blinking and stayed still for about 30 seconds then it started to move and blink again as it went slowly across the sky vertically West to South.  It started to get smaller then just disappeared as I was looking right at it. As the red light disappeared I noticed a second red blinking light come out of nowhere as if it just turned itself on near the original point of the first light.  I went upstairs to my daughters room to show her what I was seeing.  It did the same exact thing as the first, slowly moving upward, stopping for about 30 seconds, resuming its movement laterally and blinking then as I was watching it started getting smaller and disappeared.

As I have been watching this object in the sky for a few months now.  I know it is aware that I am watching it because every time I look threw the telescope it moves closer to where I am standing. One thing I did find strange is as I was watching this object.  I noticed to other lights just not as bright as the one I was watching the formation of these  other too lights which had the same ability as the one I am talking about and are also able to hide themselves as well.  They are for sure not a star nor a plane or a satellite.  But they do have triangle formation.

I was driving to work this morning, and keep in mind, I take this way to the freeway almost every morning at the same exact time, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.  Also, I live sort of in the country, there\u2019s not a lot of activity around this time, and it remains relatively dark out.  So, as I was passing this small intersection thing, I looked down at my phone, and about a second after I looked up, there was this green light that illuminated the entire sky in that direction.  There was a lot of precipitation in the air, so it wasn\u2019t as bright as it would have been without it.  I thought I was imagining it for a second, it looked like it shot from the ground up and when I say the entire sky was a mellow shade of green, I mean THE ENTIRE SKY was green.  And after about 3-4 seconds, maybe longer, the light shrank back down, and looking in my rear view, it didn\u2019t happen again.   Normally, I\u2019d brush something like this off, but about two years prior, in the same general area that I was driving past, I had been out for a walk.  I took a wrong turn down this trail (keep in mind, it was about 3 or 4 in the morning, I was walking thru the woods and I had my phone flashlight to help guide me a little bit), and about ten feet down this trail, I had woods on one side of me, and an open field on the other and in the field, I noticed (you know how when you shine a flashlight on an animals eyes they illuminate a shade of orange or red?) my flashlight illuminated two orangey eyeballs.  I knew it wasn\u2019t a normal animal because it was TALL and it sent chills up my entire body.  And you know when you make accidental eye contact with someone or something, you feel it?  I felt it alright.   I backed away slowly until I got to the main trail and started sprinting home.  The point of backing up rather than immediately running away was to ensure that I wasn\u2019t being followed.  Now, the thing that confirmed my eerie feelings, was once I hit the road, I looked up at the sky, saw a white flash of light slightly grow and then quickly shrink, disappearing completely.  It felt like something out of a movie.   Since then, I haven\u2019t been on any more night walks.  I wish I had pictures because I feel absolutely insane trying to explain this with no physical evidence.

It was no longer blinking.","735":"Bright white,star- like,moving and stopping over Southwestern Vermont,changing course easily On Sat evening July 13 2019 my husband and I were at our home sitting in chairs in front of the house facing East at 8:45pm.  We could see the moon to the East South East,  and it was big but not yet full. It was bright. The sky was dark blue. There were no stars visable yet ,due to the still illuminated sky.  At 8:57 I stared at the moon again, this time to see a bright star to the Right of it ( as seen in the video).  It was so bright I thought it was a planet. Not knowing my stars, I just wondered.  As I spent  a minute looking\u2026it started to travel to the Right (south) about the same distance it was from the moon. It only took 5 seconds to cover that distance. Then it dead stopped.  It really caught my eye. My husband was now watching it. Then it moved Left , back to the original position. ( Video was taken after the movement) We decided to move inside the house at that point. At 10:25 pm we thought we could find some other stars to look at. We grabbed a white painters cloth and laid it in the backyard , I brought my strong flashlight with me. The sky was black with many stars . Within 1 minute, we again saw a bright star (among many that were visible that night) We were facing the West on a slight incline in the yard. Our heads were higher than our feet on this slope. We were facing Ball Mountain. Within a minute , we found a bright star traveling from right to left.(north to south) Then it stopped.  At this point I teased my husband and said,\u201d hey lets call it over, maybe it can see us.\u201d I waved the flashlight up and down and left and right about 5 times, immediately  this star started moving in our direction  (now it headed East).  It traveled quickly and directly towards our part of the sky. When it got close , it stopped. We were really frightened. I was sorry I flashed the light at it. We picked up the cloth and ran into the house. We did not go back outside. We did not speak about it. We do not know what we saw. We don\u2019t want to know. \u2013 I do not think satellites change course like that. I don\u2019t know if spy drones fly at night. I am unable to research this to my satisfaction. These flying stars were the brightness and size of a night time star. ( no trails, no other colors) If anyone can explain, we would be grateful.","736":"Slow moving orange glowing ball went across the sky and then suddenly disappeared.  Quite a few neighbors were outside and saw it too.  Strangest thing i've ever seen!  Lasted 5 minutes and it made the news here as my neighbor has a photo of it.","737":"Unblinking 'star' dot of light moves right to left, zips off, followed by aircraft several minutes later I went out side last night around 10pm EST to have a small cigar. The area I live in is relatively rural, so on clear evenings like last night I usually stare at the stars while I smoke.  If the direction I was facing is 12 o'clock, then to my 1 o'clock I thought I saw a light (the size and brightness of a star) move 'next' to a relatively bright star.  I assumed it was my eyes playing tricks on me and adjusting to the dark.   Scanning that general area a few minutes later, I saw a single dot of light moving from right to left.  Roughly to my 12 o'clock. To clarify this was up in the sky, but 12 o'clock to where I was facing. The dot of light was the brightness of a medium brightness star.  Definitely not twinkling, and I was watching it intently for flashing (indicating an aircraft) and there was none.  There was also no noise whatsoever.  I served two years in the USAF and can confirm that if you can see an aircraft, you'll be able to hear it.  And I also know that if it were an aircraft that was far enough away that the running lights would appear that small, it would have been moving much much slower, to the eye of an observer on the ground, than this was. After maybe 15-20 seconds of watching this point move from right to left, it seemed to stop for half a breath, and started again just before disappearing completely.  The way you might expect something to \"zip\" away. Needless to say my heart went into my throat and I could feel my eyes go wide. I stood there scanning the sky where the light had been when I first saw it moving, where it disappeared, and further to the left to see if it was still there, for several minutes.  Trying to rationalize what I'd just seen. I probably could have shrugged it off as just being something weird, if it weren't for what followed . I can't say how long it was, definitely less than 10 minutes, that I heard air craft engines.  Looking up I saw running lights (red, green) so this was definitely an aircraft.  There were two of them, one coming from my six o'clock, and one my 12 o'clock.  Both appeared to move fast enough that I knew they were essentially directly above me, and from the distance of the lights that they were high up.  They passed each other in a 'two lanes of traffic' style.  There was also a third aircraft off to my two o'clock, some distance off. The two aircraft that passed each other traversed the roughly exact area (meaning the one coming towards me was coming from it, and the one coming from behind me was heading towards it) where the spot of light had been. Given the proximity (chart-wise) of where I am to the airport in Bangor (Bangor International Airport, BIA), seeing aircraft especially at that time of night isn't an anomaly.  But the flight paths are ALWAYS either to the left or 10 o'clock to where I was standing or to the right or 2 o'clockish to where I was standing.  Depending on whether they're departures or arrivals respectively. To the best of my memory and knowledge, aircraft never fly in a path directly over the house, one way or the other.  And especially not at the same time. I continued to scan the sky for another 10-15 minutes before I came back inside.","738":"Six Objects in teh NW Sky Last Wednesday I saw six objects in the NW sky.

However, this was my first sighting of a mother ship!!!  In the northern sky heading west to east I saw and object that was about 6 to 8 inches long from my point of view.  There was no sound at all.  It had 6 lights with the second light from the rear being slightly larger than the other 5, example:(oOoooo) on a cigar\/cylinder shaped object and it was moving slightly faster than a satellite.  If this object was in low earth orbit, it was over a mile in length.  If it was in the inner atmosphere then it was at least a quarter to half mile long!  I wish I could tell the exact height in the sky to give you a better description of the size, but I just don\u2019t know. I really hope somebody else saw this object in the sky as this sighting kind of freaked me out.

Every single night around 2:30am till dawn while watching the stars we see what looks like a staring the sky moving very fast,  they have to be traveling at thousands of miles an hour.  And we own a powerful laser pointer and each time we shine it it will disappear and then reappear in a different spot in the sky, or they will up here to come closer and then turn on a 90 degree angle and move away out of sight very quickly.  And then it will not be long before we will see another one, that will act the same way with the laser pointer.  This happens every single night and is quite impressive.  And sometimes they just fly past very fast but certainly under intelligent control.","748":"5am i woke up with a strange feeling, but could not open my eyes, i tried do anything to open it and saw then on one of my Picture Frames these green orb light. i started staring at it, then it cames near to my face, near, more near and i easily pushed it with my right hand away.  i touched threw it, there was nothing to toch or feel.  these thing was going threw my hand and id needet 2 seconds till these orb startet going slightly backwards and when doing that it changed his form.  it was an orb and startet to be an cube then dodecahedron, and even much more i cannot explain. it was like it is rotating then from the inner side, wich i could see threw all the gaps and the outside was routating too. the color stayed all the time the same.  it was like a glowy green mandala machine wich can transform to every sync geometrie even ones we never saw on earth yet.  it dissapeared when it reached my window by going back from me while transforming. it has just faded out by the glas from the window. just wantet to tell my story.  it was some day june 2015 i dont know it exactly. not 2019.","749":"I have never seen anything which moved so fast without noise in my life. 8\/17\/19 3:36 pm In the sky above Stoddard Pond, Winchendon, MA 01475.

I have seen helicopter flying.  I have seen a drone fly by.  I have seen many birds, bats, bees, geese flying over the Stoddard Pond. This small black DOT was first stationary in the south sky, which caught my curiosity.  As my eyes were locked on this DOT it began to move heading northwest to our house!  But maintaining height.  After 5 seconds it suddenly changed direction and turned 90 degrees and sped toward the West.  Within 2 seconds, it disappeared from my view.  By the time I rushed over to the sliding door it was completely gone.  When it turned the DOT became like a hot dog - still black.  It happened in complete silence. I told my wife, who was sitting next to me but she could not find it probably because of where she was located due to the window casing. At the exact time this object shot off to the west our house security alarm system was triggered.  I tried to shut it off by entering the code which worked for 30 seconds, but it came back again and again.  Finally, I shut it off by turning off its electrical circuit breaker.

I work as a food delivery driver in Madison, Wisconsin, and on July 13th, at approximately 21:35 hours  I had a delivery to make and I happened to glance up into the night sky to the south.  I\u2019m used to seeing various aircraft, both Civilian, military and commercial come and go through Truax field.  But this didn\u2019t have the typical aircraft light set up with the Red and green navigation lights, nor was there typical landing lights.  Plus growing up near Davis Monthan AFB, I knew my aircraft well. This was 4 red lights in a vertical diamond formation, in an up and down diamond, not a horizontal layout.  Rather close to each other with no real space in between the lights as an aircraft would have between the wings.  The object was hovering in the air, not moving at all. I was at first thinking it was possibly a drone since it was just hovering.  It also made no noise whatsoever, unlike a typical light aircraft or commercial aircraft.  And it certainly wasn\u2019t a F-16 thats stationed here.  Compared to the near full moon, it was maybe a quarter the size of the moon.  I continued watching, pulling my car over to watch it more.  Two bicyclists peddling past also looked up, but continued peddling north. At that point the object was moving north,  and I lost sight of it through some tall trees blocking my view.  I moved further south  and looked back to see the object heading north.  Then stop again.  And then  it split into two objects, both of 4 red lights.  And quickly both sets of lights left the area.  One heading north, the other west.  It took just a few seconds to lose sight of both.  I had viewed the object\/objects at most a full 2 minutes.","758":"Fireballs spotted over Higgins Lake in same location as prior event. I was camping at South Higgins Lake State Park when a large fireball object started to appear across the lake shortly after sunset.  This was in the same location that I spotted the same type of aircraft on 7\/11\/2014.  Just like before, the object grew in brightness and intensity, split into a second object and then a third, disappeared and reappeared.  This occurred and continued on and off for about 20 minutes.  The fireballs were orange in color and incredibly bright!  Comparing where we were standing to a map on our phones, it appeared that the lights were above or near Roscommon.  I previously thought that Grayling was in that area, however I was incorrect. The object was hovering above the tree line and then would sink below the tree line, however the brightness from the fireball(s) would create a glow behind the trees.  Eventually the dancing lights.  There were 5 witnesses, all were adults. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It made zero sound, I tried hard to listen for helicopter blades but there were none, nor was there any sound from engines or turbulence.  The object made a quick bank to the right almost completely horizontally, and then back to the left before altering it's original course.

They then returned to their original position, about 10 degrees apart, one above the other and appeared to be moving backwards and forwards from each other.  Kind of oscillating. They stayed this way for a few minutes and then began to move apart, one going up, the other going down.  Then they moved back again for a few minutes.

As I drove through the mountainous part of the highway, where there are no structures, I noticed a line of big lights of different colors hovering over the top of the mountains.   At first I thought it might be a house, but the lights were too big, and at some point I would've passed the house.  Yet, as I kept driving the lights were still hovering over this mountainous peak.   Once I started to make my descent on the road, I could no longer see the peak of the mountain and lost sight of the lights.  I saw them for about 5-10 minutes of driving as I was driving up the road and the peak of the mountains\/hills were visible from the highway. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The sky was already dark with no cloud cover and stars were out.   National weather service out of Missoula reported winds aloft at 60mph out of the NW over Hamilton, MT at 10:00pm mountain time.  Once I noticed the first light, I could see another traveling along a similar path as if one was following the other.  They were both equally bright and where much bigger than any object such as Jupiter or other planets or stars.  They were easily10x bigger than the biggest planet or star.  They were circular in shape, possibly slightly elongated when at their brightest.  The first one slowed and stopped directly overhead making no sound at all.  While the first one remained stationary and the second one continued towards the first, the first one dimmed and became smaller to about the size of the stars out at the time.  Then the first one vanished compl! etely. Meanwhile, the second one while still moving also dimmed down to a smal star sized object and completely vanished as well.  While all that was going on further in the distance a third object following along the same path caught my attention as well.  The third object was orange as well but different than the other in that it appeared to have an orange energy field surrounding it making it much brighter.  The main part being what seemed about the same bright orange as the first two objects, and the surrounding orb surrounding it a much lighter shade of orange.  This energy field that I call it made the third object 4-5x bigger than the main center object that it was surrounding.  The third object never came as far south as the other two so my view of it was not as close.  It may have been as far away as five miles to the NW when it reversed its direction and started traveling back in the direction from where it had come from.  Then it too faded down to a tiny orange object,  like the others and vanished as well.   Hamilton is in a valley that sits at an elevation of around 3,500ft with surrounding mountains between 8,000-10,000ft.  I would guess that these objects had to be over 10,000ft in elevation or higher.  None of them made any sound that I could hear and it is very quiet here on a Sunday night with almost zero wind at the time.","787":"I saw a solid bright light moving across the sky in an erratic fashion and then it blinked out of existence. I was on the phone with a friend of mine and was looking out the window of my bedroom when a light appeared heading north from the top of the window.  I thought at first it could have been a plane but there were no flashing lights and it was moving around the sky erratically.  It was heading in a general northern direction but was curving to the left and right in ways that a plane couldn't have.  I then thought that maybe it was a drone but those too have flashing lights and it seemed close enough that I would have been able to see them.   Once it got about three quarters' down the length of my window it stopped moving and then just disappeared.  There were no trees or anything that it could have moved behind.  It was just in the sky, and it just blinked out and was gone.","788":"Objects with red lights moving in the sky, but the moving objects with red lights faded in the sky. I observed 4 rectangular red moving objects traveling at different speeds.  Slowly the moving objects faded in the sky.","789":"White light with red and blue blinking lights, seemed to stand still in sky 1 hour saw object with constant white light with smaller blinking red and blue lights.

Watched them almost constantly for an hour.","790":"Just gotten on highway 94, looked to the left, and saw a very low flying small plane (very boxy and flat) which seemed to go in and out of focus almost fuzzy\/pixelated, disappeared.","791":"The UFO was going about 70 or more mph over a river. It was gone within a blink of an eye. It looked like a circle then a ring around it.","792":"Shiny high velocity object following airliners performng extreme manuvers. Seen shiny sphere following multiple commercial aircraft.  Craft flew a horizontal line, stopped motionless the flew erratic loops the made dramatic 90 degree turns at extreme velocity the disappeared.  This happened 3 times at 10 -15 minute intervals.","793":"Silent cigar-shaped object flying over Avon, Ohio At approximately 7:45 pm EDT on the evening of July 14, 2019, my wife and I observed a white or dull silver cigar-shaped object move steadily through the sky in a roughly easterly or ENE direction.  Remarkably, it had no visible wings, tail, or engines; was producing no contrail; and was utterly silent.  By contrast, several ordinary commercial jets that we observed just before or after this object \u2013 were all readily audible (even when apparently farther away), had plainly visible wings and engines, and were leaving prominent contrails.  Birds that we observed flying overhead at the time had obvious heads and flapping wings, again in contrast to the object in question. If the object was the size of a medium-sized commercial airliner (hard to tell), I would estimate its distance as about two to three miles away.  The weather was clear, the sky blue with a few high cirrus patches, and visibility essentially unlimited.  The sun was still brilliantly illuminating everything in the sky, since it was more than an hour before sunset. I was viewing the object with binoculars, while my wife was viewing it directly without optical aid after I brought it to her attention.  Our sighting lasted roughly 30 seconds, from the time I first noticed it in my binoculars while idly scanning the sky until it moved out of sight to the northeast.  The object did not noticeably vary its speed or direction at any point during the sighting.  It appeared to have small dark markings at its rear and along part of the bottom.  It did not look fuzzy but had distinct outlines. The sighting overall was completely unremarkable except for the absence of any sound, contrails, or visible wings or engines.  I was left wondering whether it might possibly have been a small private jet with unusually quiet engines, flying banked so that its wings were edge-on to our perspective (and hence not observable by us), but several considerations argue against that hypothesis.  First, we should have heard engines, no matter how quiet, at its modest apparent distance and compared with other aircraft in the vicinity just before and after our sighting.  Second, it is extremely unlikely that a normal aircraft would have maintained a bank of about 30 degrees (which is what would have been required to put any wings edge-on to us, given its height in the sky from our position) continuously for half a minute in what appeared to be essentially straight and level flight.  Third, if an aircraft had been flying past in an attitude such that its wings were edge-on to us, its tail (vertical stabilizer) would have been plainly visible, contrary to what we observed.  Fourth, as noted above, conventional jets that we observed at approximately the same time were all leaving obvious contrails.  So, in conclusion, I do not know what we saw, but I\u2019m contributing it to the database in case the information is useful.","794":"7 UFOs were seen in New Haven CT, July 14, 2019, at 9pm Exactly at 9:00 pm, I saw some moving objects. I was able to record them on my iPhone. All objects moved the same direction, but on a different distance from each other. No sound.  The video of the events is here:https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lDeE-7Vn9IE","795":"On July 14, 2019, (Sunday), Eastern Standard Time,  about 9:20pm, I was driving along Hillside Avenue in the area of Alpine, NJ, in Bergen County.  The sky was dark since the sun had already set down. The road was a bit hilly and I was driving upward close to the intersection on 9W right before stopping at a red light, when all of a sudden, an illuminating bright light sped quickly straight across right before the intersection across my path and stopped abruptly a few yards behind a tree on the right corner of the intersection.   Then surprisingly, a second later, another bright, illuminating light sped quickly just as the first light and stopped right before the first bright light stood.  As soon as the second light met up with the first light, they both zoomed straight out to the right and quickly disappeared.   These bright illumination lights happened in a matter of 2-3 seconds only.  That\u2019s when I realized that I just encountered a mysterious sighting that happened in a split second.","796":"Bright Orange Light from large Black Triangular Vehicle constant altitude, course and speed, no noise. On the evening of July 14, 2019, approximately 9:25 PM EDT,  I was driving home from dinner along Cleves Warsaw Rd, travelling west, glancing out the window to observe the conjunction of the moon with the planet Jupiter occurring that evening in the southwest sky, when I noticed a bright orange light which appeared to be moving slowly from west to east.  What I immediately notices is that this object did not have conventional aircraft navigation lights, tail beacon, or belly strobe light as you would expect to see on a conventional aircraft.  Nor am I aware of any aircraft having an orange headlamp, and having been a student pilot earlier in life, this intrigued me.  I was really trying to see what this object was. \tI continued to drive, until I was able to reach a parking lot, where I pulled in facing south, and I watched the object, travelling at a constant speed, which was relatively slow, my guess would be 30-40 knots, on a steady course towards the east, in the direction of downtown Cincinnati, OH.  The object passed slightly south of where I was parked, about 80 degrees off of vertical at my position, at an approximate altitude, my guess, of 1500 feet Above Ground Level. \tAs the object flew past me, to the east, the orange light flickered out, it didn\u2019t just shut off.  All through its flight, at every angle, the luminosity of the light had been constant.  Once the bright light was gone, I could clearly see a very large black triangular vehicle (perhaps the size equivalent of a Lear jet) continuing its flight to the east, and was able to watch it until it faded into the distance and into the darkening sky (the sun had just set, but there was still quite good light throughout this event). \tThis object made no sound at all.  Its course west to eastward took it perpendicularly through the final approach glideslopes of three major runways of the Greater Cincinnati\/Northern Kentucky airport.  There was no encounter with an aircraft as it moved through perpendicular to all three runway 18 glideslopes which run north to south. \tI do not know what this was, but a few days later at dinner at a friend\u2019s home, I was told that their son and his friend also saw the same object that same night about the same time from a place that was about a mile east of where I was parked that evening, and that he had called his parents for them to go out and look at it, and his parents missed it.  At dinner that evening on July 18, there was speculation about a drone, sunlight reflecting off an aircraft, and yet to me, that doesn\u2019t explain the lack of engine noise.  I\u2019m wondering if anyone else saw this, and they would know what it was.","797":"fiery orange ball off Florida coast On 07\/14\/19 near 2220 hours at Siesta Key on the West coast of Central Florida, I was sitting outside in a chair in the courtyard of a single story resort. The area is mostly dark, unlit, with only a few area street\/building lights. The sky was clear and there were about three puffy storm clouds nearby but all out over the Gulf or Mexico and to the South of my location.  It was a typical Florida summer night, hot and muggy with little to no wind and almost a full moon.  I had a clear view of the sky straight ahead and to my left.   To the right side of my view, the sky was mostly visible between the sparse tree branches\/leaves of a 15 foot tall decorative tree.  I noticed through the foliage of the tree was a very bright fiery orange ball.  It was at approximately a 45 degree angle in the sky from my seated position.  The object was as intense as the flames typically seen coming from rockets after leaving Kennedy Space Center.  However, this was not an oblong flame, it appeared circular. The object had the same orange intensity on all sides and across the middle. It did not appear that any side was more or less lit up as it slowly moved across the sky. There was no visible trail left behind the object as it moved, no blinking lights, no change in intensity and no audible sound.  It was moving very slowly from the north to the south almost horizontal. I confirmed its movement by watching it traverse across openings between the stationary tree branches. I estimated it traveled from my view approximately one inch across the sky in twenty seconds. After watching it move for approximately five minutes, I estimated it was approximately one mile up in the sky and about a mile west of my location out over the Gulf of Mexico.  Watching the object, I walked through the open courtyard and then into the street to be in an unlit area when the object disappeared over the course of four seconds.  It went from its standard full size and brightness to half the circumference and half brightness and intense orange color. Then half of that circumference and a dimmer orange-grey color, then half of that circumference and grey, then completely non-visible. I gave the appearance that the orange sphere moved due West out of sight at a very high speed. I initially thought it was possible a storm cloud had begun to cross in front of the object obstructing the view, but the lonely storm cloud was still south of where the light disappeared. ( Total visibility time of approximately 6 minutes.)  I went inside and told the wife and kids of the weird light. I went back outside with the kids two minutes later. At 2229 hours, back in the courtyard we all see it the orange object. It was the same size, shape, color, fiery intensity and distance away as before. It was again very slowly traversing the sky from North to South.  We walked out to the dark street monitoring it. It still appeared to be about a mile out over the gulf and a mile up in the sky as we watched it for three minutes. Comparing it to the stars in the sky it appears to be 15 times the largest visible star or 20 times larger than the smaller stars. If a pencil point on a paper was a star, the eraser of the pencil was the size of the orange object.  Moving at a very slow speed horizontally from North to South, the light stopped moving for approximately two to three seconds, then changed direction and began to traverse in the complete opposite directions now from South to North at the same speed.  Nothing changed with the fiery orb during the direction change other than the direction of travel. We all quickly return to the room and enter.(Total visibility time 4 minutes)  I grabbed my camera with zoom lens and rush back outside one minute later. The light is gone and unable to be located. I walked to the beach and find no one with drones or Chinese lanterns. Returning inside I checked the weather website and determined cloud elevation was 6000 feet. When the object disappeared the first time it was half way up in height from the bottom of the storm cloud it was near so the object was possibly at 6200 feet. I estimate the object was moving at approximately 10-15 mph.","798":"fiery orange ball off Florida coast On 07\/14\/19 near 2220 hours at Siesta Key on the West coast of Central Florida, I was sitting outside in a chair in the courtyard of a single story resort.

I was turning on the road before my neighborhood and I saw a bright light and the cars in front of me hit the break lights.  I slowed down and saw something REALLY  bright. It was too bright for headlights or helicopter or planes.  I stopped tried to record it but my phone died instantly and my screen in my car went out at the same time because my music stopped.  It wasn\u2019t making any noise at all.  My car didn\u2019t die but everything just got weird. It was super bright and was hurting my eyes.  I just was scared because it was just super bright, lighting up only my car and nothing around it. It moved towards town and then started turning up straight like a rocket but the light was still shining bright. I started to drive slowly towards home and then the real odd stuff happen it shot directly upward fast as hell! I wanted to tell my wife but I knew she would make fun of me.

As I scanned the sky, I saw a very long straight line of what appeared to be randomly connected lights.  Whatever this was wa incredibly long.  It seemed to be high in the sky, but I have no way to know its altitude.  I actually thought it could have been a mile or more in length.  But, if it was lower than it seemed, it would still have to be a few hundred feet in length. It moved what seemed to be slowly, but I really have no idea since this would depend on how high or low it actually was.  It was almost above me when I first saw it and I watched it continue in the same direction in what seemed to be a straight path.  I watched until it disappeared.  If it was 1 light, I would have assumed it was a satellite.  Unfortunately, I did not CV count the lights, but I estimate around 10 lights randomly spaced.  I have seen 2 other very unusual things in the night sky over the years, but this was by far the most unusual.","804":"Silver Cylinder Flying Dark over the Far West Valley Guarding a construction site quite aways out into the desert that doesn\u2019t usually have a lot of air traffic, save a freighter coming to Phoenix every now and again early in the morning. Co-worker and I were sitting in a new area facing the open desert, when I happened to glance up and see what appeared to be a plane or similar flying very low and VERY almost alarmingly slow.  There were no indicator or headlights of any kind, and no noise that would suggest a plane engine.  I happen to have both a flight radar and an Air Traffic Control tower app on my phone, and neither picked up a reading from it or any sort of distress call. It appeared to be a silver cylinder or cigar shaped object headed East towards Phoenix.  The lights from a nearby site reflected off the bottom of it as it cruised over and we watched it for several seconds before it suddenly turned and bolted North into the open darkness VERY quickly.","805":"Line of orbs moving through the night sky My son and I were taking pictures of the milky way in Pine valley.  We had setup my camera on a tripod facing east and set it with a remote to take pictures while we waited in the car.  As we waited I happened to glance up at the sky and noticed a line of orbs moving from west to east across the sky.  There were at least 30 small balls of light maybe more all in a perfect line and moving in the same direction.  There was a large group in the front and then a space with about 4 or 5 more behind them in the sky. In all the time I have been taking photographs at night, I have never seen anything like this.

This other light was at rest in front of them then moved behind them and shortly after they all disappeared either from being too far in the horizon or something else.  The line of lights is substantiated by other people. The light they met up with them that reacted to them seems to only have been fully seen by me and maybe my close friend.

With four or five individual lights of the same size trailing shortly behind, but not in formation. It took approximately 90 seconds for them to cross our entire field of view an exit out the horizon.

Sturgeon fishing around 2AM downriver from Swan Falls Dam\/Power Plant.  It had been raining and was still partly cloudy.  So visibility was not excellent.  We noticed what we first believed was meteor debris.  However the light from it did not fade, fall, or separate the way meteors I have seen normally do.  The object appeared to be at high altitude and was a long oval tube shape without clearly defined edges.  We realized it was quite unusual when we noticed what at first glance seemed to be stars shining through actually were at least 5 bright white lights along the side of the proposed craft.  They were equal in size, shape, separation, color, and placement along the visible side much like the windows of a train or bus.  The whole object had somewhat of an undulating white color which we both agreed reminded us of translucent deep sea creatures.  While it was in view it was travelling North at a very normal pace.  We were able to see it move from clear sky, then behind a small cloud and back into clear sky and then disappearing completely behind thick cloud cover.  As we stood discussing what we had just seen the clouds past and it was gone and there were no stars even remotely in alignment to what we believed to have been lights. There was no noise, colors besides white, shape changing, separation, or any other defining things about it.  Airliners consistently flew overhead during the night which we were able to easily identify and hear.  I cannot judge the altitude other than above the clouds.  It appeared to be many times larger than the airliners that passed during the night but the fact that we could not judge the altitude I cannot say much about the size for certain.  We could not think of any rational explanation and were left dumbfounded and a little unsettled.  And we didn't catch a sturgeon. ((NUFORC Note:  SpaceLink satellites??

In between the trees I noticed two bright white lights with a band of five to eight smaller lights under it.  The lights hovered above the tree lines without a sound and it was illuminating the dark road (there are no street lamps on the road).  It seemed to be getting closer to ground very slowly.  Then the motion light detectors went on at my house as well as the neighbor's.  At this point, I went inside.","815":"1st encounter:   Around 2:30 AM, was going down Murray Ave in Dalton, Georgia, as I looked into my rear view mirror, seen a very bright white light zoom from one side of the Rd to the other side across the street.

Then there was a much larger blink that had the shape of a twinkie. It pulsed about like a light on the top of a tower.  Not rapid like collision lights on a jet.   There was a low cloud cover and whatever this was was slightly in the clouds, low.  We live in the flight path for Reagan nat airport so i am used to seeing commercial aircraft.  Usually in fog the aircraft turn on their landing lights.  I think i have seen a plane where the collision avoidance lights strobed together, although what i saw moved slow and pulsed slowly and the whole object was the same brightness.

No navigation lights either. also the path that it was traveling i should have seen it sooner b\/c it would have gone in front of me which it just sort of started it pulse run to my right.","818":"Cylindrical object moving against the wind, no visible control surfaces Monday August 19. Around 4:35 p.m. Saw a cylindrical object just east of Tonkawa, OK flying north to south.  Object appeared to be like an aircraft fuselage but without wings or tail fin. As I observed the object move to the south I got a view down it as well, still showing no wings.  The object was grey; a little reflectivity but not much.  Altitude would be a guess but I\u2019d say under 10k ft.  Speeds appeared like an airliner would have. No contrail, no noise.  Could have been a balloon but it would have been trucking it on a calm wind day.  Winds were from the south as well.","819":"strange shaped craft over Auburn WA Wife and I were heading to the store when I looked up and saw what I first thought was a hot air balloon.  When I looked again, there was no movement from it, and it stayed stationary for some time.  Took a pic of it and almost looks diamond shaped with two arms, one from top of craft and one from bottom (didn't notice until I looked at picture to see the arms).  Craft was darker in color.  Almost a shiny dark grey.  Then as soon as it was there it was just gone.  No way a hot air balloon could travel that fast.  It wasn't even a windy day today.  Still can't figure out what it was.  Just glad I was able to snap a pic.","820":"Silver, shiny cylinder shaped object spotted with no noise, no wings, no lights in Creston, NC. On August 19, 2019 at approximately 7:02 p.m. ET in Creston, NC, I saw a silver cylinder shaped object about the size of a bus moving through the sky from a northeast direction toward a southerly direction.  No noise, no lights, no wings.  It was moving quickly and although the skies were cloudy, there were intermittent breaks in the clouds where I spotted this \u201cthing\u201d.  I watched it until it disappeared into a cloud. Some months back, I saw an object which looked the same on two different occasions, but there were two of them at that time.  One went over followed by another one shortly thereafter which looked identical.  The first time the objects were going from a southerly direction toward the northeast.  The second time I saw them, which I believe was the next evening before dark,, there were also two of the objects going in the opposite direction.   One following the other with a good distance between them so as both were not visible together. Someone posted a picture from California on this site which I saw and it looked the same as the object I saw.","821":"High speed, high altitude star-like object. We observed a very high speed, star-like object traveling in a south\/west to north\/west direction holding altitude.  This particular direction is uncommon for commercial aircraft along the central coast of california.  Miltary aircraft don't fly this particular direction at that altitude either.  That includes fighter jets or larger.  When they do fly higher, they leave trails with this object did not.  We observe military aircraft with  regularity in this area.  This object had no navigation lights and made no sound.  It appeared as a white to slightly orange color and except for its odd speed and altitude, looked similar to a star.  We were able to determine its height to be between 'two and three times' the altitude of commercial aircraft traveling along the south to north route, (so-cal to the bay area), by using cloud layers and other aircraft at the time of sighting, (appox 30,000-40,000 feet as I often watch them on the flightradar app),.  There were more than one commercial aircraft on the evening of sighting flying along the usual route.  The sky was extremely clear in places and commercial aircraft could be heard and navigation lights clearly seen on all aircraft.  We counted off the seconds and estimated the speed to be appox ten times that of commercial aircraft seen?  It held a straight line until out of sight - approx half the observable sky, in 10-15 secs.  Four family members observed it.

Me and two friends had stepped outside for a cigarette.  As we normally do we layed on our backs and admired the night sky as there is very little light pollution where we're from.  Me and one of my friends both at the same time verbally exclaimed at something we were seeing.  It appears to be an almost bird-like crescent shaped object moving through the sky.  It was invisible but we could still see it.  It was almost, cartoonishly invisible as the outline of it was pronounced but the inside of the object was invisible.  It seemed almost as if it was like a magnifying glass, warping the view of the stars above it as it traveled.  It was completely dead silent. I'm unable to determine what it's elevation was.  I saw it for 5-7 seconds, then lost track of it when I stood up to see it better.  My friend claims to have seen it continue flying then dissapear into the horizon.  Had my friend not seen it.  I'm almost certain that I would have dismissed it.  But now I'm inclined to believe that it was some sort of flying object.  Whether it was government technology or an alien spacecraft,  I am unaware.  All I know is that I did see it.","824":"Smoke trail across the night sky, to the south with moon in background.

I was outside on my back porch at 2300 hours looking at the moon with my telescope. There was some overcast around the moon.  It was clear over the rest of the sky. I sat down to wait for the clouds to move from around the moon.  I saw a bright light coming out of the southwest toward my house.  There were lights flashing.  No noise.  I would venture to say it was about 5000 ft up and coming down toward my house.  It is turning to a more direct east path and crossed right over my head.  I was filming it and taking pics of it with my cell phone.  The main craft was elongated rectangle with no wings.  It had bright lights at the front and back of it.  There were little orbs of light flying around it.  The large craft opend up bays doors on the bottom of the craft.  It was a very bright light coming out of the bay area but, I could see pipes and structures, beams of light flying around inside of it too.  As it passed by me I at first it looked like tail lights on the back of it but, I realized it was different colored orbs floating on the back of the craft. It was not going to fast about 50 or 60 Mile an hour is my guess.","827":"Object appears, moves, and disappears. I let my dog out the backyard.

The lights were bright white and in the shape of a slanted wrap around type.  One craft was higher in the sky than the other and that one appeared stationary.  The second identical set of lights was lower in the sky and closer to me...about a quarter mile from me.  The lower set of lights was moving lower and lower and then banked slightly as it came toward me.  There was no sound at all.  I had the feeling that the lower set of lights\/craft saw me as I was driving  the car on the rural back road as I drove home, about 4 miles from the beach. The oddity of the wrap around bright white non blinking lights was startling against the dark empty sky and a bit frightening as they were the only lights in that otherwise dark sky. The moon was out but in a different part of the sky.  The lights were 'just th! ere' as I rounded a bend in the road.  The lower set of lights came closer to me, moving very slowly and smoothly. I could not make out the shape of either craft as that was totally black..only the lights of each was visible.  I have never seen anything like it before. The lights were over farmland and fields at that point.   I stopped my car to observe but when I saw it approaching me I continued to drive, thinking I would see them as a different point of travel.  I lost sight of them as I headed to a more residential area near Rt. 1 and Moonstone Beach Rd.  I should have stayed and observed but I was too nervous as this one craft seemed to head right for me.  I drove to my home not far away and scanned the sky but could no longer see the.  The Matunuck Beach area has been known locally as a 'hot spot' for activity.  I have seen several other UFOs in my lifetime but never anything like these two craft.  No other lights were visible on them...just the two bright 'halogen' like ligh! ts that seemed to wrap around the craft. I knew the lights were connected to the same craft because as the closer craft banked closer to the ground both light remained in the same relation to each other.  The craft came from the west and were headed east.  I hope someone else saw them and may verify my observation.","829":"While leaving a bar\/restaurant situated on the beach in Matunuck, RI, driving back to my home 4 miles away, I encountered two craft in the sky.  One was stationary while kept coming closer to me as I stopped to observe.  The craft appeared as two separate lights, like identical headlights in the sky.  One set of lights was stationary while the other pair of lights moved in unison appearing to be one craft.  The lights were like car headlights except that they looked kind of like slanted unblinking lights.  The pair of lights closest to me came toward me in a gliding fashion. I waited then kept going thinking it would follow.  As I continued driving I lost sight of the pair of lights.  The night was clear with a full moon. I came back to my house which was about 3 miles from my first observance.  I didn't see them again.  The pair of lights were of one craft.  There were two craft.  Definitely UFO.

I obliged, and while passing the window to get to the kitchen I saw a white, circular object bouncing low to the ground,  I called her and my father over, and we all watched as they bounced and bobbed up and down, and every time they went down more would appear on the rebound up.  They were faintly gray from the clouds, but other than that they were pure white.  They left no trail whatsoever, and eventually they all faded.  Only on remained, half obstructed by the building in front of us, and then out of nowhere dozens of lights started whirring in the sky.  They moved in all directions, all white again, and they flew left, right, forward, and back over our property.  It looked very similar to the light speed warp scenes in Star Wars, except instead of lines it was white balls that left no trail.  After that they eventually became fewer and stopped.  The sky behind them, which was ! night at the time, turned from pitch black to a lighter, orange color, probably due to sunset but could have been caused by these unknown objects.  I ruled out the possibility of planes, and spotlights, due to the sporadic nature and speed and size of the objects.  If anyone else has seen this, then please submit your report as well.  This has been my first experience with unknown flying objects, and I am truly flabbergasted, as well as my family.","841":"Approx. 50 white\/yellow lights descend in straight line, 3 close lines, not even, spaced out at trailing end, slowly Northeast. I'm a cardiac nurse, former geography teacher.  I reported 8-10 flashes in Northern sky at 0130 this morning.  I went out for a smoke and to see if there was more activity with flashing lights at 11:30.  Looking at the same area, between the big dipper and North star.  At 11:33 I saw what I though was a trail left by a big meteor, except I hadn't seen any meteor.  It was just below the two end stars on the dipper, pointing approximately North east.  I thought maybe it was a jet trail, but then it started breaking up, and there was no jet.  As it was dispersing it was growing longer, and turned into separate lights, all same brightness.  It probably stretched from the corner of the dipper to the North Star and began moving Northeast.  The lights were in a perfect straight line.  I believe in 3 lines, but not evenly.  They were fairly condensed for the first 3\/4, but the last 1\/4 they were more dispersed, in no pattern, except in 3 rows, about the width of a c! ouple of jet trails.  Total of about 50, not changing formation or direction or speed, which seemed about the same as a jetliner.  No channges all the way to the tree tops, no sound.

May 24, 2019, Appox. 12:30pm  1 Mile west of downtown Denver, Colorado, (32nd Ave & King Street)   \tToday, May 24, 2019, about a mile due west of Denver Colorado.  It is a day with almost no clouds and bright sunshine.  I was standing outside talking with my neighbors when I noticed 6 objects to the NNE.  The objects were at a 50-60 degree angle from my location.  These objects were simply just there.  From my location they had the appearance of an object between a baseball and a golf ball.  Planes were passing over headed to the local airport, Denver International Airport that fly at approx. 12,000\u2019, less than a mile above the ground, as they have just passed over 12-14,000\u2019 foot mountains and begin decent for landing.  A private plane passed over at no more than 2000\u2019 feet above so my guess is they were 3-4000\u2019 above the ground. \tMy first thought is that these were balloons that had been released, as today is the last day of school.  The objects would have been too large to be balloons and they stayed in the same relative altitude.  Next, I thought they might be birds as they were constantly changing formations.  The idea being they were trying to gain altitude.  They moved from V to diamond to non-formation and back in a constant shifting of their position relative to each other. \tThis was not birds or balloons.  First, their size would have been too big for a bird and while I thought I saw a wing, given the size of a bird and distance it was away a wing would not be possible to see.  Even White Trumpeter Swans would be smaller, they are exceedingly rare in this part of the US and don\u2019t fly in the manner that I witnessed.  They also reflected light of a white translucent color with a hint of rainbow sheen leaning heavier towards the red spectrum.  Birds don\u2019t reflect light, which is why my mind first turned to balloons, but again the size was too large.  They had to be rather large in size . They appeared to be flying in an erratic behavior at first glance, much like balloons, but it soon became apparent these were flying in a controlled manner and altering between multiple formations. I was with two neighbors who took no interest, and I\u2019m not sure if they could see them.  I was wearing sunglasses and when I removed my glasses, I was unable to see the objects. They were not wearing any sunglasses (and chuckled at my reference to the objects being extraordinary).  My I-Phone was unable to pick up anything either.  The objects were clearly reflecting light which changed as they moved, giving the impression they were possibly spinning.  The reflecting was not bright enough to overcome the sun\u2019s glare without sunglasses. This went on for about 10 minutes.  I turned my eyes away for a moment and when looked back they were simply gone.

Since I don't have a telescope, I couldn't tell the exact shape of object, but it looks circular and it is bright.  After 15-20 minutes, the object began to ascend and the light got dimmer.

As I pull up to my driveway, outside of the driver side window, I see what I thought was the moon with a very bright orange tent to it so I went to grab my Phone so I could take a picture that\u2019s when I noticed that this object was not only not the moon, but that there were two of them and they were moving. I got out of my car and immediately turned my video recorder on.  They gave absolutely no sound whatsoever and couldn\u2019t have been moving faster than 25 to 35 miles an hour.  If I had to guess I would say they were about 3000 feet off the ground.  The one in the front eventually lined up with the street that I was on and stopped.  The other one followed behind it a little slower and sort of lined up next to it.  It hesitated for a moment but then flew under the other craft and stopped for a moment making a Vertical line.  This only lasted for about 10 ! seconds before the bottom craft continued to make what would end up being a half circle and lined up again on the other side of the craft that was stationary.  Both crafts eventually flew off in the distance no faster than they had moved when I first laid eyes on them.  I was fortunate enough to be able to record the incident on my cell phone.  The footage is a little bit shaky as I am struggling to process what I\u2019m seeing as it\u2019s happening. These craft look to be orb shaped however it almost looks as though there was a slight tail coming off of them.  I don\u2019t know how to describe it better than that.  Overall the craft were red but in the center there was more of a brighter orange type glow so the red coloring would\u2019ve been more of an afterglow.  No sound was emitted from these objects during the entire duration.  In the video the only sound you hear is of me talking my cats who honestly sound a little concerned given how they were reacting my car running in the background and crickets.  I don\u2019t know what this was but I do not believe that it was something that was man-made.  If it is they did a damn good job of convincing me otherwise.","859":"Very loud and it was slow. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Helicopters seen shortly after flying around until dark. First witnessed one craft slowly moving north in an unusual rate of speed (stopping completely at times) and at a low altitude (too low for a commercial aircraft)..  I pointed this anomaly out to my family members and we watched it for about 15 minutes until cloud cover blocked our view... this craft reflected the sunlight and was pill shaped. About 20 minutes after this incident, we witnessed another 2 crafts, moving across the sky from east to west, same shape and slow rate of speed as the first.  One trailed the other moving at the same rate of speed but not across the exact path.  We were able to observe these crafts for approximately 10 minutes total until they disappeared from view.  Shortly after this helicopters began working a grid pattern through the area until after nightfall (which also seemed bizarre for our area).","862":"Orange light being followed by jet aircraft. I was at a camp fire and I saw a circular light that was a light orang color with one small white light in the bottom of it, it was being closely followed by another aircraft that I believe was a sort of small jet aircraft I pointed it out to my friend who was beside me at the time I pointed it out it went behind a pine tree then came back into sight with the the other aircraft still behind we saw it for a few more seconds then we lost sight of it behind more trees.","863":"Some time in the next week or so, 3 large groups of Unidentified Flying Objects will be visible in the sky.  Around 20:00 and 23:00 you will be able to see 3 groups of bright orange lights up and to the right of the moon.  These UFO's should be able to be seen in Arizona.  There will be a sudden drop in temperature and the wind will pick up. The nature of the Extraterrestrials currently remain a mystery. Prior to and following the sighting of these lights, we will start to notice mass bird and insect death. Temperature in the south states will be fluctuating and sporadic. Nasa will start contemplating the removal of all personnel from The International Space Station. Russia will refuse to leave and start doing research on the nature of their visit. Numbers of strange gateways and people vanishing will increase. Anomalies such as Gravity shifting to crop circles will rise. Japan will start focusing on how to defend ourselves in case of attack. Most of the world will start focusing on advancing in technological growth such as new fuel sources and deep space exploration and defence vessels. Hidden secrets and mysteries will be brought out and shown to the world. Mysterious men and women will start appearing in the streets and will appear to be surveying the land. A base in antarctica will receive a communication from the swarms of ships. They will inform us that we are being studied to see if we are suitable to join them on the journey. A select 10,00 people from each country will be taken and tested. The selection process will be at random taking adults and children. The world will fall into chaos and rage.  The greatest minds will start working together and come up with a way to get war ships into space.  We will then communicate with the Aliens and be informed of an experiment they started during the time of indians and ancient tribes where they integrated with our societies. A calling will happen and all the people who are their ancestors will remember their reasoning for coming to Earth. An alliance will be formed between earth and the other civilization. Earth will be given advanced technology and embark into the next chapter of life. From that point on we will be trained for colonization of other planets and space exploration. There is a spot of time before the alliance where a slight battle will occur and we will be pushed into being a military planet.  The precise dates are unknown but it will happen soon.","864":"Bullet shaped object burning up falls towards Chicago, then changes directions and shoots away July 16 2019 My partner and I were attending tonight\u2019s regular Full Moon Fire Jam on the beach along with a hundred or so other people.  My partner made a comment about the planes tonight, she felt like they were moving a lot lower and faster, they seemed more colorful than usual and were interesting to look at so I was laying on our blanket face up staring at the planes in the sky.   After a while of spacing out I realized my attention had fixed on a bright object that wasn\u2019t the moon.  At first it was just a bright red-orange light headed towards earth from the East, if the projectile landed it would be a little bit North of us.  After a minute I asked \u201cDo you see that?\u201d.   We watched it for another minute, trying to understand what it was. My original thought was a foreign space object somehow missing a tail, but my partner\u2019s was that it was a bomb.  She has better eyesight than me and later claimed that the thought of it being a bomb came from the way the light shone against! the surface of the object, like wrapping around its nose, \u201cIt looked like a bullet.\u201d.  It was big, how big is hard to say, but big enough that if it did crash to earth it would destroy the city.   We got up and started to leave, but when no one else followed we questioned our decision.  \u201cIt\u2019s still there.\u201d  I noted, and we both watched it for a few more seconds.  From my perspective it seemed to stop and immediately change directions, now moving parallel to the horizon towards the North, away from us, but my partner believes it \u201cslungshot back the way it came\u201d.  It was completely gone within a second.   I posted a vague question about it on the Fire Jam Facebook event page and two others described the event as well.  I don\u2019t know if what I saw was intelligent life, technology, or space junk, but whatever it was, it made my heart fall into my stomach, I could hardly believe what I was seeing was real.  I feared for my life.","865":"Constant bright white light appeared to be falling from the sky, went out before reaching horizon but 3 orange lights kept falling. We were sitting around the campfire in Zion National Park, we saw a star-shaped white light much brighter than any star or satalite ive ever seen.  The light was knear the horizon and was moving at a fast pace towards the horizon (straight down).  It seemed almost like a shooting star but had no tail and stayed a constant brightness.  Before the light reached the horizon it suddenly went out and 3 small orange lights dropped from where the light was.  The three orange lights seemed to go out just before reaching the horizon.  There was no sound. Initial light seemed to be moving at the pace of a shooting star or a falling object.","866":"I saw a small bright white light at high altitude a bit to the Southeast moving slowly from Southeast to Northwest. I walked outside to take the recycling to our bin and was looking at the moon in the South before catching the light peripherally to my left.  At first, I thought it to be the planet that has been in the night sky near the Moon as of late, but then realized it was in a different position than that.  I then thought maybe it was a plane as a good number of them fly over this area, but it seemed to be moving slower and there was no low rumble accompanying it.  I then concluded it must be a satellite.  That made perfect sense until the light slowly began to reduce in size and fade.  I took a few steps to my left to see around a tree branch, but it evanesced just after I caught sight of it again.  Perhaps it was just a meteor in the atmosphere?  Or ball lightning at a high altitude?  Seemed a bit lax in speed for those as well though.","867":"I was laying down for bed when I looked out my window and seen a bright light in the sky.  I at first thought my eyes were going cross when the light split into.  The two lights kind of danced a little bit and rejoined then dissipated.","868":"A bell-shaped orange craft over neighbors home. At 4:00 A.M. my dog woke me up barking and licking me. She never does that and I thought maybe she had to go out. We walked out my front door and I noticed a bright, glowing, orange, bell-shaped object across the street over my neighbor's house towards the NW. It glowed a vibrant red\/orange color and was reflective. It was very low between 100-200 feet from the groud. It was cloudy and a little bit foggy that morning and it was well below the cloud-deck and above the fog. It hovered silently and distored the air.  It was unusualy quiet outside.  My dog was jerking me around on the leash trying to get back inside. (She is a service dog.)  The object had a dome with several porthole-like windows around it.  It looked to have what appeared to be a dark ring around the tower of it.. It had large orange lights on the dome section and a pattern of orange lights circling the base of it.  I took two pictures and decided to take my dog inside because I was going to try and get better footage of it and when I came back it had left and I could see a small orange light far in the distance towards the NW.  I was inside no longer than 10 seconds. It left very quickly.  I sat outside for a brief time incase it came back.  It never did.  When the craft was present and for a brief time after it left the street light was flickering.","869":"Moving north north west.  Low flying.  No noise, no blinking.  Round and bright.","870":"Thought it may have been a satellite  but idk had no flashing lights just looked like 1 or possibly  2 bright lights but it could have been sun reflected also but it traveled  from SE to NW and went out of site not super fast but fast enough to travel across a quarter of my visible  sky but I didn't  notice  till I was looking at what I think is the big dipper to the SE of here anyway it made no sound like an airplane would after passing so idk maybe they are flying space shuttles or something  it may be nothing  serious just seen it and asked my kiddo to come verify it didnt have flashing lights or make sounds","871":"Huge pentagon shaped object, silver in color, 4 white lights underneath, red & orange light on either side, possible door open. My adult-aged daughter and I were driving on I-295 North toward Yardley, PA, and shortly after passing the Scotch Road exit #65A, we started to see a really bright light in the sky ahead of us.  It caught our attention because the light was low, really bright and large, as if it were the moon; however, it was too low, too bright, too cloudy and late to be the moon.  Also, it was staying fixated in one spot\u2014it didn\u2019t seem to move or change in size as we got closer to it.  It was also NOT an airplane because it was approaching from the opposite direction of planes seen landing in this area at Trenton-Mercer Airport.  I was able to get two images as I was driving and you are able to see an incoming airplane to the left of this other object--the airplane lights are super small in comparison to the unidentified light\u2014and the lights of the airplane were getting bigger and clearer as we drove closer, unlike the other bright light.   As we crossed over the Scudder Falls Bridge, the lights were to the left of us and we saw the object.  It was hovering about 10-20 feet over the tree line directly over the bank of the Delaware River in Yardley, PA.  It first reminded me of a drone about the size of a house but as we got closer, we saw that it was a solid silver colored pentagon shape.  There was a small red line on one side and a small orange light on the other and then there were 3 or 4 super bright white lights under the object.  It looked like a door was open on the side and white lights were lighting the inside.  I saw steps coming down, but my daughter did not.  She saw remembers something sticking up and out of the back end that looked like tail wing.   We got off at the next exit and turned around to see it, but it was gone.","872":"Orange-Red Sphere\/Ball of Light. Very large orange-red ball of light\/sphere traveling at moderate speed, E - W in sky. Object was much larger than a star, left no trails, seemed to sparkle, but did not flash.   After object disappeared above tree cover, it never emerged from the other side.  I\u2019ve seen enough satellites & planes at night to know this object was not one of these.  I figure it was something burning up entering the atmosphere from space, but wanted to report it just in case.

Was drinking by the fire on a Tripoli rd site, the sky finally cleared up and we were talking; looking at the stars.  My site was down a thirty foot embankment next to the road, by the river.  You could see cars go by barely.   Anyway, out of the corner of my eye while looking up, I saw what looked like campers had set up a string of lights.  We then realized we\u2019ll thats the road and it was actually near the treeeline over Mt. Osceola.   As myself and two friends processed this we realize the string of lights were moving fast and in a straight line very close to each other.  They looked just like the stars, pure white but moving ina straight line.  Non pulsing and non color. I ran up the embankment to catch the tail end of the formation before it went out of view, behind the mountains to catch a better view.  There were at least 30-50 pure white lights, straight line.  At the end was one smaller pulsating color object that slightly bounced around like a nat.  Think Orion\u2019s Belt stars filled in like a hiking trail .......... straight line,same color, same size.  Later saw a plane fly by and did not compare one bit to previous objects.  I grew up next to Logan, was a military soldier in Hawaii, I\u2019ve been near airports all my life.  Never seen anything like this.

But then we noticed that it had a tail on the end. It looked like it was very close to us, seeing as how the orange color was so dominant.  It kept getting closer, yet was slowly hovering above the houses...then at that point i thought maybe it could have been a drone since it was moving so slow.  The orange color was still present, and appeared to be coming closer.  I walked over to get a better glimpse, and within seconds, it turned to the right; and shot off into the sky.

I noticed multiple (3-8) balls of light streaking across the sky from the southeast direction.  The lights were sometimes coming forward, backward, left, right, randomly over the sky, even over our house.  At times they would stop in the air for a few seconds and then start moving again.  They were moving very quickly, faster than anything I have ever seen in the sky.  I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before.  I went inside and woke my daughter and we watched the sky from a large window together.  Once inside, there were 3-4 times when in addition to the streaking balls of light, we saw the skyline, just above the tops of the trees, light up very brightly in multiple colors, mostly pink and white. After at least 10 minutes from coming inside, I woke my husband too.   He also saw the balls of light moving randomly across the sky.  Shortly after, from the skyline emerged a large oval object, like a glowing white light much larger than the streaking lights.  This object hovered in the skyline and didn\u2019t move.  Then the object disappeared and re-appeared.  The balls of light stopped streaking and it all suddenly disappeared.  We waited for at least 10 more minutes and nothing reappeared.  Whatever we saw was over. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Cancel Posting May 25 regarding event May 24, 2019 - Mystery Solved I submitted a report yesterday.  We learned last night from a neighbor that there was an Elements Festival - a Music & Art Event in our area which included a light show all weekend. It must have been the lights from the show we saw with the flashes at time.  It was at 11:30 p.m. so it seemed very unusual to us.  As I said in the original post, I have never seen anything like this before in the night sky.  Please remove our original post Saturday, May 25, 2019 at 09:16:11.  We now know what it was and doesn't appear to be anything unusual.  Thank you. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  Sky was clear, according to the witness, at the time of the sighting.

Walking home last night from my job in the SOMA district, the moon was big, bright and beautiful.  Zipping back and forth past the moonscape appeared what I believe was a helicopter.  It seemed to be following this gigantic bright red ball of light.   At first sight, I thought it was a planet, like Venus, or even a traffic light.  Oddly enough, the ball of light\u2019s starting position was to the west side of the moon and gradually moved to the east side and then back again.

I spotted a satellite moving south, just below the constellation of Cygnus.  It was faint, approximately 6 magnitude, since I could not see it with my naked eyes.  I thought I was holding my binocular unsteady since the satellite was moving erratically.  I realized it was the satellite that was erratic since all the stars in the background were steady.  Its course was constant, never stopping, but the pinpoint of light was moving about in squiggles, like holding a laser pointer in an unsteady fashion.  Sometimes it appeared to do a complete circle.  The amplitude of the erratic behavior was about 5% of my binoculars view.

I had recently started star gazing often at night because of a high occurrence of shooting stars in the area and sometimes in the early morning hours I would see satellites or space debris reflecting through the air.  Recently Trump had threatened his nuclear weapon button was bigger in response to North Korea Nuclear tension via Twitter so my assumption for a while for what I had viewed that night was it was a defense test or Space-X Rocket Launch from the Brownsville, TX, location.  I did not report this incident initially, as coming from a military family and having been educated in Mechanical Engineering, I assumed what I saw was a missile defense deflection test in preparation for any foreign nuclear attack. I walked outside and looked around the sky trying to allow my eyes to adjust to the darkness which would allow me to see stars and satellites easier as sometimes being next to a larger city the stars can be harder to locate.  The night sky was clear enough from cloud coverage for me to be able to locate stars in any direction.  About 2 minutes after being outside I noticed a group of 3 stars around 72 degrees east that were brighter than when my head had panned that direction previously.  Now visually fixated on these objects, I noticed that the objects were tracking NE in regards to my position and phone compass.  Being the large pessimist I am, I tried to downplay what I was seeing and assumed them to be air planes of some type.  But there were no strobe lights or jet sounds so I thought these to be space debris for a moment.  As a few seconds go by, I realize that it seems as if these equidistant 3 white orb objects are traveling in triangle formation.  There roughly at abou! t 35 degrees upwards in relation to my point of view.  Only about 10 or 15 seconds into the ordeal I made a split second decision not to go grab my phone (stupid) in a selfish act to keep watching the event unfold as I had never seen anything like this before but being someone well versed in mathematics and engineering was convincing myself with logical thinking what I was seeing was nothing to be excited about.  Calmly, I watched at about 45 seconds into the entire event as a middle orb seemed to appear out of thin air.  The objects began to track back towards the eastward direction slowly but changing directions simultaneously with each other moments after the arrival of the new orb.  Remaining equidistant to the new object the three whitish orbs slowly started de-accelerating to a full stop in coordination with the new orb the air.  Levitating there for a few more moments as the event reached the 1 minute mark.  The original 3 orb objects at this time started moving around as i! f they were trying to push this new orb that appeared by directing themselves underneath the new orb.  The original orbs were starting to move around the new orb erratically unlike anything I have ever seen before. Zig Zag patterns is the best description but staying equidistant from the new orb object.  At this time I noticed strobe lights of airplanes coming from a local air force base heading towards the objects coming from the Southeast direction at 116 degrees.  As the jets made it to around 75 degree east track the new orb surrounded by the original moving orbs started to glow orange slowly.  Over a period of 20 seconds the new orb grew to be larger and larger and seemed to gain luminosity as bright as the sun in the night sky but only in that area of the sky.  It looked like an atmospheric re-entry of a large object but the other objects around it seemed to speed up during this process.  The orb toward the right of formation shot off faster than I have ever seen anything travel in my entire life.  It covered around 6 inches of sky in less than! a 1 second span.  I assumed this object was traveling mach 5 or 6 but there was no explosion or sounds.  All I could hear were the jets at this time that were now approaching it within my range of view and most definitely theirs.  It was obvious these jets were tracking these objects.  The orb that traveled away from the formation went like a chord through a circle in regards to my visible atmosphere.  In less mathematical descriptive terms, the object was like if you were to have shot a bullet through the top portion of an orange.  The object was moving so fast it almost looked as a shooting star would have in regards to speed but this object was more gathered and had no comet tail or sparks.  The new glowing orb faded and each orb slowly one by one flickered\/disappeared from plain site.  Whether these objects just traveled beyond the atmosphere slowly or not..they just vanished. After not being able to confirm that there was a space x launch and others in the area reported seeing the same thing I took it upon myself to report it.  As a credible witness soon to earn a degree in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in both Mathematics and Psychology\u2026 What I saw is definitely artificial. I would assume at this time it is advanced defensive or just raw technology possessed by the United States Government being it was so closely after the nuclear arms arguments.  This is why I did not report it for a while but now I realize if it is an adversary that has the technology.  These objects are being reported around US military bases frequently.  Reports like this might be useful into tracking the origin.  Regardless of my opinions..it does not change the visual event that occurred.  So I decided to come forward with the report even though people usually are shunned for this type of thing.","902":"Immensely bright, white, saucer shaped, object directly positioned directly over our home for 54 minutes On the night of April 18, 2019, upon returning to our home, my husband and I saw an immensely bright, white, saucer shaped object directly over our home.  I remarked how bright it looked.  My husband replied that it was too bright to be the moon.  I proceeded to take some photos.  After a short while my husband went into the house. I continued to observe this, for what I thought was only a short time, but my husband recalls it being around 45 minutes.  The time recorded on the pictures supports my husband\u2019s recollection of time.  The first photo taken at 9:23 p.m., the second photo at 9:24 p.m., the third photo at 10:17 and the fourth photo taken at 10:18 p.m.  Spanning a total time of 54 minutes of the object silently hovering above our house.","903":"I saw a UFO hover over South Los Angeles. I was outside taping this annoying helicopter that was constantly circling my neighborhood at around 2 or 3 in the morning.  My intention was to take the video to the police station and file a complaint about them frequently using our community to practice their loud flight patterns early in the morning.  When out the right side of my peripheral vision I saw this object hovering in the sky.   I watched it as it moved into view of my camera, then towards the helicopter, before it sped away at what looked like lightning speeds.  Now, I know some skeptics are going to say, \"It could have been a laser light source,\" but that helicopter was at least a mile away from my house at the furthest part of its circular pattern.  What kind of laser light would I be able to see from standing on my porch approximately a mile or so away?  Who would have such a powerful mechanism to shine into the sky where it would be visible to others for miles?  Look how that object moves.  It is definitely an unexplained flying object hovering over South Los Angeles.  Hell, for all I know, that might be why that helicopter was in the air.  This sighting completely changes my perspective about a lot of things. https:\/\/youtu.be\/2UeW31KlaZc ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was a stormy day with dark low clouds and high winds.  The craft appeared diamond shaped and hovered a mile or so from the airliner that was on final approach.  After the airliner passed, the craft flew straight up towards the low storm clouds, rolled onto its side, and the shot into the clouds headed into the wind. after which we lost sight of it.  I caught 24 seconds of video of the craft that I am uploading with this report.  At first we thought it was a drone, but it was in the flight path of the airport, was above the jet liner and appeared nearly the same size as the jet. Way too big to be a drone.  And it hovered, flew vertically, and shot into the clouds head into the wind at high speed.  Definitely NOT a drone.","905":"Black and yellow object in sky at Sequoia National Park.

No idea it was there when photo taken, as I saw or heard nothing, other photos taken of scenery do not show object.  Was black on bottom, a yellow line across the top and upon zooming in appears yellow is 2 circular spots.  Appears to have wing vertically and some type of aura around the object, is unlike any sighting or photo of UFO that I have seen or heard off, the distance and apparent size of object are strange and I think would rule out a bird or insect.

I photographed a luminous cloud above the corner of the house and the light sphere on the right side was not visible to the naked eye ! I made several photos, and with the Sun's sunset this object moved little with the planets.  In the photos, the light resembles the light of the moon a bit(The moon is never on this place)!  But the height remained the same.  There could also be no focus reflection between the clouds as the clouds moved and the Sun was much lower than the first photo.  This light sphere remained behind the clouds.  It is also not an internal reflection of the lens.  I took photos with a good smartphone camera. I am also the person who, many years ago, with his own eyes, saw the incident that years later was reflected by N.A.S.A. and later the Russian Space Agency.  It was a case. where an unknown flying object was shot from a land-like type of missile and the object moved sharply at the last minute ... I saw it with my eyes and the binoculars myself.

I could not determine the height due to the unlit area matched the dark sky, it looked like it was in space.  Looking at arm's length about three feet long (very large) and an inch wide.  The object I saw was just dots of white lights like stars.  More in the front area thinning to the middle, one light \u00be to the end and one light trailing at the end.  All the lights where moving at the same speed heading west to east.  The speed seemed to be about the same as a commercial jet at cruising altitude.

I thought it may be the northern lights so I yelled to my buddy look. As it got closer we realized that it was a bunch of round lights in a single file line at different distances.  First they were close together and then some further apart.  We thought comet or space debris.  As they continued we realized that it was to low to be space debris. The objects were maintaining the same distances from each other the whole time.

When we looked into the sky, we saw what appeared to be 50 or more stars moving in a single file from the west to the east.  The lights\/stars were close in proximity and there seemed to be a few lights or stars that were quite always from the others but still aligned perfectly behind the other lights\/stars. We could not see any shape it just looked like a string of lights going across the sky in a straight line. If you were to take your hands and put them 6 to 8 inches apart from the beginning to the end of the formation (I could not begin to explain how many miles that would be in comparison) that would be how long it was.

Hopefully there is some kind of information about this. I am a skeptic. My wife is not but when I saw that this evening the hairs on the back of my neck stood up.

Around 2.10 pm I saw a triangular object rise over the horizon on the northern side of the beach (airport side) and shoot vertically into a cloud.  The cloud was relatively small and the object didnt fly out on the other side of the cloud.  I told my wife who was siting alongside me what i just witnessed and both of us eagerly kept observing the cloud hoping to see the triangular object fly out.  As we were trying to spot the object fly out again, a second similar triangular object shot out of the north horizon and disappeared in the same cloud vertically at a very high speed. since the airport is in the backdrop, I remember seeing a commercial airline take off around the same point in the horizon (norther part of the beach) much slowly as compared to the speed of these objects which atleast seemed to be atleast 5X times the speed of the airline. Both my and wife couldnt believe what we saw.  I had my camera wit! h me that fished after the second object entered the cloud and started panning the horizon to spot them.  After 5 mins or so, I saw two figher jets circling in the distance over the mountains and the clouds trying to look for something.  I was able to take pictures of these jets which were possibly scrambled from the base nearby.  The jets were twin engine\/ tail jets and couldnt in my mind be mistaken with the objects I saw earlier.  Another thing that was peculiar, that if the commercial airline jet that took off from the airport at 400+ miles an hour speed and these objects easily flew at 5 times plus speed, that implies that they flew supersonic but we didn't hear them making any sound.","946":"4 Orange Orbs that Flickered like Candles Observed I was at Ivy Hill Cemetery with a close friend on 07\/03\/19 waiting for the local fireworks show to start.  About 15 minutes prior to the firework show, an orb appeared in the sky from behind a large tree.  The orb was orange and flickered like a candle.  It was like a ball of fire.  It appeared to be very distant, maybe over the James River, but high in the atmosphere.  Two more of these orbs appeared from the same location and they each went in separate locations until they formed a large triangle in the sky.   From our perspective they seemed to be travelling slowly, but considering the distance and likely height of the orbs, they were probably moving quickly.  Then one by one the lights vanished as the orange lights slowly faded out \u2013 from a sizable orange ball to a pin of light to nothing - they vanished slowly. Then, just as the fireworks began a fourth orb appeared from the same location and traveled like the first three until it was obscured by the fireworks display.  After the fireworks, we stayed in the cemetery until midnight and did not observe more of the phenomenon.","947":"MADAR Node 110","948":"It changed shapes one more then one occasion.

While lighting fireworks and watching neighbors fireworks in the sky I seen what was the shape of a triangle coming from the NE.  At 8pm there was still enough light to make out aircraft that was in route to Ontario airport or an nother destination, and they were frequently moving at a predetermined amount of time, I could see the helicopters flying in and out infrequently, but you could tell they where helicopters, a couple of low flying private planes could also be seen, but then I seen a triangle moving in from the NE then turning and going south.  The group wasn't moving fast and was pretty quiet compared to all the FW's that was going off.  I looked in my truck looking for my binoculars it wasn't there and I wasn't carrying my phone.  So I moved to a darker area to focus on those aircraft, and I could make out bands on the wings, I want to say they that they had two green bands, one on each wing, but it was dark and what they were escorting was a very bright! golden\/yellow craft that I could not make out completely but that it was very bright and leading the two escort jets, and they headed south.  From my perspective if you hold you two fingers in the air, arm extended, and leave a gap of about an inch, that's approx how close they were.  My only fault is I didn't record anything.","951":"Traveling from West to East the height, brightness, size,shape and speed of the international space station but over 50 in a straight line one behind the other.

The plane was a large transport type with no windows.  We both noticed something was wrong with the plane.  It didn\u2019t make any noise, but that wasn\u2019t the strangest part.  Neither one of us can say what the problem with it was, but something was off about it.  The plane disappeared over the trees heading north.  I turned my truck towards the south and we immediately spotted a black craft moving strangely.  It was shaped like a cell phone, kind of rectangular.  It was falling like a leaf, then shooting forward for a distance before coming to a stop and spinning.  When it would shoot forward, it would move very fast and come to a stop without noticeably braking.  Just an instant stop.  It would then fall like a leaf again, swaying side to side and slowly dropping, before shooting forward again.  While we were watching this, another ! object appeared.  A silver sphere.  The sphere is debatable.  It could have been a standard airplane light, but it is worth noting, as it is in the video.  I was filming from the side of the road and had to move the truck.

Friday, July 19, 2019 - At 9:50 PM EST, I was in the swimming pool at Post Ballantyne, when I saw a bright object, like a star (but three times bigger) or a satellite (four times bigger), flying north at about 15,000\/20,000 feet.  I am always fascinated and very interested in flying objects, and I know that this was not a star, not a shooting star, not an airplane, not a drone and not a helicopter.  There was no engine sound.   A minute later a saw a second one, and then a third one, and a fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh.  Two minutes later I saw ten more, and ten more and then ten more.  Three minutes later I saw twenty more, and twenty more, and twenty more.  They were not flying in formation, rather randomly.  There were three other people with me in the pool, a man, a woman, and a child.  I asked them if they could see what I was seeing and they were totally surprised to see the flying objects.   We tried to take photographs with our phones, but they were too smal! l for the cameras.  The objects were flying in direction south to north, slightly west (5 degrees) from where we were.  They kept coming for the next 20 minutes.  Between 10:00 and 10:10 PM was the largest number of objects flying at one time.  Always flying at the same altitude, same direction, and same speed.  Then they started to decrees (contrary as they had started) until I saw the last one at about 10:20 PM.   I am a pilot and a keen observer of the sky, and I do not believe in UFOS, BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING very fascinating that I had never seen before.  Quite intriguing and fascinating.

It would be visible and then disappear, I watched it do that 3 times.  At first, he thought it was something related to the fireworks that I was seeing, but he realized it was not fireworks when the light came back and moving fast, from south to north then abruptly making a sharp turn and headed east, then it just vanished.  This happened a couple of times before I had the presence of mind to get my phone and try to capture it on video.  Literally the moment I started to video it, it vanished. Waited and waited, but it didn't come back. Until after the next weird ass thing happened.  As I'm looking for this light, I see an enormous blue laser light cutting across the sky.  I've never seen s laser that was that big, nor have I seen a blue one.  My house is situated on a hill overlooking the valley, the orangish light had been over the mount! ains to the west and the laser came from the north (either from Colville Mountain or very close).  The laser beam was very big and the intensity was so strong, it stretched across the sky. It was very brief, though.  I have talked to a third person who also witnessed the laser, but from another location.  After the laser went out, I noticed the orangish light was back, but now it was in the vicinity of where I had seen the laser.  Once again, it flew along the tree line, back and forth a few times before it disappeared.  I did get some video of what was happening, the quality is horrible (I am not an accomplished camera operator), but the light I was seeing is distinguishable.

It caught my attention because the usual object first appeared to be perfectly still and did not show any characteristics associated with a helicopter.   Later, it moved south at what appeared to be an extraordinarily high rate of speed.   When it accelerated, I believe I heard a faint, very low frequency rumbling.  Otherwise, there was no sound associated with the object. The object featured three lights in a triangular pattern.  When I looked at the object through binoculars, I could clearly see that one of the lights was a steady red and two were alternating between green and red.  The alternation occurred on a regular basis changing roughly once per second.  There was no evidence of landing lights on the aircraft, and through the binoculars I could make out what appeared to be a triangle. Yes, this was on the Fourth of July. But this clearly was not any kind of firework.  I also found it odd that if this was a research aircraft of some type, that it would be flying on a night when so many people would be looking up towards the sky.  10pm is a typical time for fireworks displays in this area.

Some seemed brighter and bigger than others in the line.  It was not a perfectly straight line but fairly straight, as some were higher, while others were lower, but overall it was a line of them.  Some were bunched together in clusters with gaps between other small groupings either ahead.  Then many seemed to follow one after another individually.  The lights were all white.  They were solid white lights, not flashing, though some lights seemed to merge into other lights or simply fade out and pop in at a different spot as if appearing from nowhere, but all traveling in northern trajectory together heading from the perspective when they were first noticed. As they traveled farther away the brightness of their lights faded from view. From the moment when they were noticed to when they faded out from view was perhaps 3 to 5 minutes. While I tried to record them on my iPhone 10, they were too faint for the camera to see them. I then tried to place the phone lens to the Night Vision goggles but getting the lens in the right place and then guessing the direction of view from the lens without having my eyes to it made for unfocussed and shaky video footage that did not reveal anything that I could make out, compared to when my eyes were to the lens. I have taken a daytime still image from my back porch to better depict the scene.","999":"50 or more light spots in a straight formation There were maybe 50 lightspots in a very straight formation, at the begin of the tail there lightspots were close to each other and towards the end of the tail less and less dense, lenght of the tail +\/-200meter or even longer.  At the end of the tail the spots were not regular spaced. The spots flow over Zaventem airport towards Antwerpen.  The speed was quite low, similar to and normal airplane.  Plausible explanation, a meteor that exploded but quite odd to have so much points.  I tried to take a video on my mobile phone, but got only a dark video. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD))","1000":"Mass star migration in a staight long line Straight long line of star-like lights, moving at a speed faster than an airplane much much smaller than a falling stars.  (I think comparable to that of the ISS passing.)  Looked like an ordered mass star migration.  The first part of the line of star-like lights was very dense, with many lights following close to each other.  Then the line got less and less dense, and some lights were following at distance much further (maybe at 3 times the length of the dense part).  All in one very straight line. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD))","1001":"I looked up when talking to my sister to see a straight line of what seemed like a hundred or more white lights in a straight line moving north.  The lights were about a mile or so long and high in the sky.  When I ran to try to get a clear photo the lights dimmed and faded out. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD))","1002":"Saw what looked like a meteor streak in the sky on a clear night, looked closer to realize it was a cluster of stars moving through the sky.  It looked like 100 stars clustered together moving as one object in a line.  Me and 3 others stood there in awe as it made its way behind the mountains.  It was the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.   It was also by Beale Air Force base. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites?  PD))","1003":"At least 18-24 square shaped bright reddish orange lights moving across sky in a single row for at least 2 full mins At approximately 1:08am, I happen to look up into the northern part of the sky & seen what appeared to be, as I went to slowly focus my eyes, a row of what I counted to be (at first, that is) 18 bright reddish orange lights that all appeared to be as the same size from 1 end to the other.  Every light also appeared clear enough to be able to see, with the naked eye I might add, that they were in the shape or form of almost a perfect square.  As I looked & became to stare at this row of lights for about 30 seconds, I finally spoke loudly to my friend asking (excuse me for the profanity...) \u201cHey, what the **** is that?!\u201d  Then I again excitedly asked \u201cHey (*his name*), what the **** is that?!\u201d  He, who was sitting up on the porch, which btw faced east, had then stepped off & walked out to where i was.  This was just to the edge of his driveway to which he now also faced north & w\/out any hesitation whatsoever, had seen exactly what I was seeing as well.  The lights ! were in a straight line & were moving northeast.  Now there was also a plane that was flying in the same general area\/part of the sky.  At least, so it seemed anyway to which I\u2019m sure the way the angle\/direction was to where we were looking from.  The plane seemed to be much closer to where we were though considering the speed it seemed to travel & area of sky it seemed to cover compared to how these were moving themselves.  As the plane seemed to further itself away in the sky, we kept our eyes on these lights.  So as we kept viewing them, my friend raced inside to get a night vision camera that he has while I stood still & never took my eyes off of the lights. They remained in a tight row & seemed to now be as many as a possible 30 or more. I only was able to surely definitely count a now total of 24 as something began to take place. As my friend raced outside with his night vision camera, I myself was trying to use my iPhone camera but both were unable to get these lights to ! appear on either one of our camera screens. I really don\u2019t kno! w how to explain why that was occurring. I asked how many lights he was seeing & he said he was counting somewhere around a possible 30 himself.  I know there were more than 24 at one time but can only say for sure that I had took the time at one point to count out 24 of them. Now as all this was happening, we were really asking one another of how sure each of us were in seeing what we were seeing & all of this was actually happening to which we both kept assuring ourselves that this was something that was actually taking place in the way that we were experiencing it to which is the same exact way that I\u2019m describing it here. I apologize greatly for the rambling but I hope you can understand how excited & overwhelmed I am still up to this very point as I try to so greatly detail any\/every little thing that both I & my friend can recall for you. Now, after a minute & a half or so had gone by, over the next I\u2019d say 15-20 seconds (in what seemed to be a best estimate of) perhaps then ab! out 12-15 of the lights start to, I guess, dissipate then.  Now I don\u2019t mean in anyway close to how, let\u2019s say how a tail of a shooting star\/meteorite tends to look like. When I say dissipate, I mean to just slowly fade out into a continuous dim.  As if you were to sit & watch someone slowly turn a rotary dial type light switch from fully on to dimly to just dark & without any flickering whatsoever. The first 6 lights in the giant row of squared shaped reddish orange lights remained just as bright as they did throughout the entire 2 mins of this entire event from 1:08 AM to 1:10 AM. They seemed to just totally remain 1 right alongside the other staying illuminated just as bright as they were when I first saw them at 1:08 AM. So now, it is (what I counted to be over n over again) just 6 lights left to which all remained lit & together, no one or the other within the tightly grouped side by side 6 of them dissipating\/disappearing one before the next. Then at approximately 1:10 ! AM, all 6 just disappeared in an instant but in a strange sort! of \u2018ins tant\u2019. The 6 of them seemed to disappear in a ... i don\u2019t know I guess almost as if to say the dark sky sort of \u2018vacuumed\u2019 them up and just... gone... like that, period. Then just... nothing. I don\u2019t know how else to explain it but to say it was as if you\u2019re looking at the front of a vacuum at eye level & you were to watch a piece of something such as dirt or dust for example & it literally just gets sucked up into the vacuum. Well, that is the very best & most accurate way to describe how differently & unique these last 6 lights seem to then vanish at the end of this most bizarre incident. Now there are some things I want to include & make very clear of as well. First off, neither 1 of us ever seen any sort of \u2018ship, craft and\/or structure\u2019 of ANY kind. I say this & find it most important due to the comments I want to include in further describing the \u2018square shape\u2019 that I clearly saw in looking at these lights. A really good way to describe what we were looking at would be! , for example, take the fuselage of a passenger airplane. How all the windows are lined up next to each other & then say, have each one wide open with its blind pulled all the way up. Now as for the color\/light & glow it seemed to create... I guess I\u2019d say to imagine the inside cabin to be on fire, maybe? I suppose that\u2019d be a way to describe the such glow and illuminated reddish orange shade that was being put off in each single segment of light. Now I was able to record the last few seconds of all this on my phone. Well, let me put it another way. I have the last 4 - 5 secs of us talking to one another in excitement as I\u2019m holding my phone towards whatever this is in the sky yet as I mentioned before, nothing seems to come up on the screen. I just cant help but to feel frustrated bcos of not just myself but to have another person that I know so very well and can trust in knowing that he\u2019s seeing the same exact thing I am. Yet, neither camera we\u2019re holding and filming with! are able to pick it up. Even with the lights being as bright ! as they were while dissipating into all but the last 6. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. I know this all comes off as sounding a bit crazy. I know how I\u2019ve been my whole life in hearing such stories from different ones in describing such bizarre & crazy so-called UFO\u2019s. I\u2019ve got to admit though that I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019m about to feel the same in what most of these people have went thru as well in experiencing such a crazy incident(s) in their life. I\u2019ll just say that \u201cHey, I know that both my friend and I are a couple of smart middle aged guys who are intelligent in each of our own field\/trades. We both stood there for a couple of hours after the incident was over & tried & tried to explain what it was and\/or could be but even after speaking to just a very select few of certain ones close to each of us, we really cannot come up with a logical answer. I know I can speak for the both of us though in saying that we would give anything to know what it was that we actually saw last night on Ma! y 25th at btwn 1:08AM and 1:10AM in the N to NE sky of Payneville, KY. Please if any1 else saw this described incident, I ask that you share as well in what you may have seen and perhaps what your opinion may be. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.

The 2 weeks prior to this event I had the feeling at my house which I live in alone with my dog and cat, that I was always being watched could and could never seem to catch the shadows\/figures that seemed to be everywhere but no where in my house outside when I\u2019d go look for something. I\u2019d catch black figures and slight Shadows outside my windows in bushes. I\u2019d see a white orbs floating around that were very clearly different from the fireflys out I\u2019d see a white light floating behind one of roses Bushes. That night I had gone to the rest room my friend had let my dog off the back porch where she chased something that wasn\u2019t there she proceeded to chase it til the start of the small section of woods that I had seen other Shadows had disappeared into.  When I walked out the door I heard my dog growling at something that neither of us could see at that moment my friend! looked over at me and said you have aliens walking down to her she had all the hair standing up on her body and when I gave the command to go track or find what ever. Peering into the woods not seeing my dog or anything we heard a shuffle in the fallen leaves then what seemed to be a high pitch screech high and louder than a jet engine would sound. After we went inside and tried just watching some tv and hang out from then on it sounded like little pebbles or something was tapping the side of my house and windows.  About 30 minutes later I went on my back porch to put some clothes in the dryer while in the laundry room my friend standing on the back deck starts insisting we need to get inside now seeing floating orbs floating around and a distant figure standing on the edge of the woods only being able to see its shape. We proceed to inside and from there it got even worse. My friend got the vibe and feeling that he didn\u2019t wanna sleep on my couch. So I let him crash in my b! ed with me after turning out the lights and tv the whole house! seeming ly started vibrating the sounds of things hitting off my house became more intense the glasses in the kitchen vibrating we can both hear them in the cabinet. Sounds of languages and conversations that we could not understand start happening. Bumps and bangs in the back of my house where nothing was on and locked off from my animals through the night. My dog laying in bed with us seemed to start to growl then just stop like something calmed her. My cat popped in for a second said hi instead of sleeping on his bed in my room he left. After that I tried to sleep and my friend said he was going to try and mediate after that I can slighty remember not being able to move and a white light peering through my closed eyelids. The flickering of figures filling in around until at the same time me and my friend both popped up and when the lights came on we both had looks of sensory overload like someone just hit a reset on our Brains both in a what the fuck just happened look we tried t! o go to sleep with the lights on where the same thing happened. Until we both arose again at the same time looked at each other and said we need to get the fuck out now. Backing out of my driveway we both seemingly picked out a figure with some sort of owlish face standing in the woods. We left the house for the night. My friend went to a person who is open about this sort of things she took him to a spiritual cleanser she heard the story and said that it was out of her league. After meeting up the day after we both seemed to have IV prick marks on our arms in the same locations. Bruises and scratches and he had a mark on his side that looks like a medical device poked implanted something. Just seeing what the community has to say or what might be recommended. Sent from my iPhone","1014":"Outside near midnight the sky lights up, brightly, by a tear shaped orb of light with swirling colors, then suddenly its gone. \tFirst,I am slightly embarrassed and hesitant to provide this information, but I really need to know and understand what this was I saw. \tI'm guessing near midnight, I happened to be outside heading to my car, from a friend's house to head home for the night.  When I noticed something directly above the tree line.  I was carrying a flashlight as I walked to the car.  I pointed the flashlight in the direction of the dark object in the sky, unsure as to if my eyes were playing some trick or if there really was something there.  As I pointed my flashlight at this, whatever it may be, the sky literally lit up.  It went from rather dark to quite bright, all at once. Just above the tree line, I now see a super bright something I cannot even describe.  My first thought was, what is a helicopter doing so low to the ground, and for whatever reason I started flashing my flashlight on and off as if I wanted to communicate with the helicopter.  Then I notice this helicopter is making no noise, and has no wind of any kind.  The next thing I notice is, as I started flashing my flashlight, it turned colorful.  It had colors literally swirling around and around this object, reminding me of a small helicopter completely enclosed in glass with fiber optics within, causing these colorful lights that are spinning around and around this object.  The colors seemed mostly oranges and reds, even blues and yellows but swirling around and around very fast unlike anything I have ever saw.   At this point I am yelling for people in the house to either come out or at least look my direction to see how bright the area was lit up.  Just as fast as it was there it was gone, literally in the blink of an eye. \tI do not know what I witnessed, I keep assuming some sort of military aircraft or something to that effect.  But, I need some sort of explanation.  There was no sound, no wind and I really cannot say for sure, but I swear I thought I could make out a single figure inside these lights, but I am truly uncertain on that.  The more I think on this matter, more and more questions seem to come to mind.  Now, I am scared my imagination is running wild with this.  Though, when my friend did come out to see what all the screaming and yelling was about, he can attest to how truly freaked out and uncertain I was about everything except this object was really there and not imagined. \tAfter having thought on this a week or so, and having looked up and read various reports on-line about FBI surveillance aircraft, and military testing I now and more uncertain than before, because that don't make much sense.  This is a very rural area near Smith Mountain Lake Virginia.  What could possibly be there that would ever need surveillance?  Again, I am uncertain as to this, but it is certainly something that my eyes and limited knowledge did not and do not recognize.  I am very hesitant to even tell anyone about this, but I would like to know if its something explainable. \tI just used a notepad on my laptop to compose this small report which does not have a spell check built in, but I have done the best that I can with this.  I hope it is enough to be taken seriously. \tThanks for any time and effort involved in reading this.  I do give my word on my very name that this was not imagined.","1015":"I was talking with two friends of mine.  We had just returned from a night out at a club in Tampa.   We were standing outside talking, when I saw a VERY bright orange light to the north moving upwards vertically in the sky.  It changed from orange, then to green, disappeared again, and then turned orange.   In about 1 second, it turned green and moved horizontally at light speed, then bright orange, and then green before going off into the distance.","1016":"Bright, illuminous object- sometimes spherical in appearance. On my way to work on June 22 (night shift), I noticed a bright object in my peripheral vision.  No stars really visible at this time as the sun was just starting to go down.  Upon closer examination with my iPhone camera, I noticed the object seamed to move, in place. Hard to explain, but the video may help clear it up some.  Weirdly shortly after video recording the incident,  I had seen on social media and a few other sites that I use to research the topic that several witnesses in other states we baffled by bright spherical objects high in the sky.  I read that several comments were claiming it to be a ufo, while, some skeptics of the ufo topic said \u201ccase closed\u201d it\u2019s a high altitude balloon released by google.  And apparently  that wasn\u2019t the case because it\u2019s my understanding that google actually commented on the post in reply stating they do have high altitude balloons, but do not have any released in the Atmosphere as of the comment.  Strange, I believe I may have witnessed what several others from various states had seen.","1017":"4 crafts\/objects in night sky. Each one occupying a particular, navigable direction.  Moved in manner that defied physics. Phenomenal. Exactly Four crafts hovering and zagging, in different sections of the night sky with a full moon being the backdrop.  It seemed three of them were waiting for the one in the most southernly direction to do something bc its light was the brightest and it was the one closest to the ground.  The motion of all of the other three crafts were quick horizontal and vertical movements, in relation to where each craft was positioned in the sky but relatively stationary.  The one in the northernly direction moved more erratic than the others and thats what made it known that me and my friend were looking at something unusual.  None of the crafts made noise nor was a sound barrier broken when the easternly one moved an absurd distance in less than 1.5 seconds and came to an immediate stop and hovered stationary again.  Then all 4 crafts, points of light, whatever they were, dashed and disappeared in a southernly direction simultaneously and instantly.","1018":"Bright orange oddly shaped object sighted near Knoxville, TN.

I sat on my porch and observed the scattered fireworks crackle in the sky.  However, unlike the expected movement of light with any firework (a ball of light going up, reaction\/crackle in the sky, slowly trickles down) I saw something that moved very differently.  What I saw was a small red or orange circle going up in the sky at a 45\u00b0 angle (or at a slope) extremely fast.  Mind you this sighting was a few seconds, but as this ball of light continued to travel it suddenly stops and a flash of light appears or opens up in the sky.  As the flash of light was about to close or disappear the light (or ball of light I don\u2019t know at this point) continued its straight path and also disappears.  There was no sound, just a visual, and again this was a few seconds.

After a couple of minutes at that unwavering station, the craft very quickly moved diagonally down towards the horizon where the sun had just set ten to fifteen minutes earlier.  The most striking elements were the regular period and the brightness of the flashing light, and the speed and precision in which it moved.","1029":"Meteor-like objects with a mind of their own. Around 8:50-8:55 there were LOTS of lights falling from the sky. I was driving with my fianc\u00e9 from Cottonwood to Mesa, and I believe I was on the 101, traveling south, somewhere between the 51, and the 202. I noticed the first, and brightest, of all of the objects, and quickly woke my fianc\u00e9 so that he could see it as well. At first, it looked like a huge falling star\/firework (bright flaming rock with a sparkling tail), but it lasted a really long time (around 20 seconds), and it\u2019s flight pattern was weird. It was falling straight down for about 6 seconds, then shot right back up (2-3 seconds), fell down again in a zigzag pattern (2-3 seconds), shot straight up again (2-3 seconds), then made a hard right turn in the middle of the sky and travelled a little ways (about 3-4 seconds) before burning out. I told my fianc\u00e9 to grab his phone and start filming, and he tried but said that the camera wasn\u2019t picking them up very well, but I kept insisting that he try. Seconds after the first light disappeared, it was followed by another similar light that originated out of nowhere, high in the sky, but must have been at least 3 miles apart as the crow flies. Then another one appeared in the opposite direction.  Then another miles apart, and so on. No rhyme or reason to where they appeared.  There must have been at least six of these lights  back to back, and all popping up in random places, miles apart. . Meanwhile, there were LOTS of planes\/jets that looked like they were circling the area. At first (for a very brief second), I was thinking that maybe they were some sort of flare\u2026 but flares last for a while (about 5-10 minutes), and hover in one place before burning out. I\u2019ve seen plenty of flares from the Gila Bend Air Force while living in Ajo, and those flares are completely different than the lights that we saw.  Even the colors differ. The last one was really strange. It dropped down SUPER low (about fifty feet above some houses), and then, before hitting the ground, it leveled out, turned right, and coasted above the houses for a few seconds until it fizzled out. That would have been the perfect one to catch on camera, but unfortunately, when my fianc\u00e9 tried to view the video afterwards, he realized he hadn\u2019t been filming whatsoever. I did some research, and there were similar reports in Florida the day before, and they were saying that it could possibly be remnants of a Chinese rocket\u2026  But since when did remnants have a mind of their own and move up, down, and sideways?

Today, I was in my room in one of our vacation houses watching a movie on my laptop.  I had my window open because it was getting hot when I started to hear my neighbor's tarps start to flap and the trees right outside sway.  I thought it was just a breeze but then all of the sudden a constant flow of wind strong enough to push my blinds almost to my ceiling occurred.   About 2 seconds after that happened the double doors (made of glass) in my room started to light up.  The doors are covered by a thin sheet due to a window on the other side and I was trying to block out sun light.  This light was powerful enough to go through the window through the sheet and into my room.  The whole thing lasted about ten seconds not fast enough for me to get up and look out the window but after i got up and looked outside there was no breeze no firework signs it was quite.  There was no noise except during this for the items affected by the wind.  No firework pops or bangs.  Me being skeptical I figured it was just a gust of wind  but then I smelt a terrible sulfur smell and a burning metallic smell.  This lead me to google where I found out a lot of people report the same smells as I did.  This all occurred about 10 minutes before it was pitch black.","1032":"Super fast craft flying low leaving green trail Driving north on 130 toll road, craft with green trail went over at an alarming speed.

I was in my apartment in Hollywood near the base of Runyon Canyon watching the news coverage of the latest 7.1 earthquake that shook us last night.  My apartment balcony looks south and there was a helicopter hover just to the south.  It looked like a police helicopter but it had no spotlight on not were there many lights at all.  I think there was maybe one red strobe but I could see the helicopter from the light from the city illuminating it.  As I was watching it and wondering why it was just staying there I saw two small white objects flying in a curve around and passed the helicopter though I think they were a lot higher.  There were no lights and I could see them by the light of the city reflecting off of them.  At first I thought there were white birds but they were moving way too fast and their formation stayed perfect.  They were flying in a diamond like formation with one slightly in front of and next to the other.  As they came out of the curved f! light path they then straightened up and flew west and disappeared in the clouds.","1036":"Fleet of oval ships moving east.

She said it again with such conviction in her voice that i looked Up this time and saw what appeared at first to be in fact, an orange\/red looking shooting star racing through the sky.  It was 22:35 when this happened and we were on our way into our apartment.   The sky was partly cloudy but not where the \u201cburning orange\/red circle\u201d was at. We waited outside and stared in amazement at first for a few seconds while this light was flickering... it looked like it was fighting the clouds but there were none.   I\u2019ve seen several shooting stars in my day and they\u2019ve only usually last about 20-30. seconds tops.  We were outside watching this for at least 4-5 minutes.  So long that even a smaller commercial aircraft flew past this burning light heading opposite way and dwarfed the burning light making it look like the burning light was way higher in the sky.

As i glance back up i noticed a formation of stars that were not there moments earlier.. I couldnt believe my eyes.  It was a in formation of a triangle but looked exactly like the rest of stars. as i began thinking what it could be one of the 3 lights started to disappear then the next and then the next .  I stood for 35 min in awww only to not see the formation show again.  One thing weird i noticed is in that window of me watching the stars i never witnessed a single place.  But few minutes after the sighting planes started rolling by as normal .  This area had a alien abduction case that was pushed under the rug about a man named Sees ...  My own good friend obe had videos on videos of ufos he captured on the island by the small airport.  One day he took his own life while watching these videos....Since i was 18 ive seen an amazing amount of movement in the skys.. Its weird even the military do patrol flights up here with apaches and other helicopters almost weekly.

I saw a red round object over my house.  This is the third time I've seen it.  On all occasions I was able to videotape the events. The object moved slowly over going from the south to the northern sky.  It would sometimes disappear & then reappear.  I videotaped it the entire time. I could see that it would grow dim & then get brighter.  At approximately 19:52 it grew very bright, then expelled an object.  I thought it looked like red water.  I saw all of this without a telescope, unaided with my own eyes.  The object that was expelled was also red, then dropped straight down & disappeared.  It is visible on my Apple I phone. When I reviewed the video on my phone, I could see the object that was expelled was round & red.  My phone has the ability to enlarge the area & it is clearly round, red, & came out of the original object. The red light then moved more to the north & was level with the trees up the street from my house. It went behind the trees & didn't reappear. I am studying astronomy & have spent countless hours outside.  What I saw was not a drone, was silent, with no moving parts or flashing lights.

I am Estonian national and speak Estonian and use Google translation!  Hi!  I photographed a luminous cloud above the corner of the house and the light sphere on the right side was not visible to the naked eye!  I made several photos, and with the Sun's sunset this object moved little with the planets.  In the photos the light resembles the light of the moon a bit(The moon is never on this place)!  But the height remained the same. There could also be no focus reflection between the clouds as the clouds moved and the Sun was much lower than the first photo.  This light sphere remained behind the clouds.  It is also not an internal reflection of the lens.  I took photos with a good smartphone camera. I am also the person who, many years ago, with his own eyes, saw the incident that years later was reflected by N.A.S.A. and later the Russian Space Agency.  It was a case where an unknown flying object was shot from a land-like type of missile and the object moved sharply at the last minute ...  I saw it with my eyes and the binoculars myself.  For about two years, I watched the sky and flying objects from binoculars, photosensitive devices, and mirror telescopes around the sky for about two years.

What was really noticeable was that all lights seemed to be travelling at the same speed and on the same path.  It reminded me a bit of how you see in the movies a long train travelling across the praries at night and what you see are the lights inside the passenger cars moving in unison.

The lights were in a string or line formation. This formation appeared to be heavily clustered near the start of the formation, and the end of the formation.  The objects in the middle of the formation were not as clustered (more space between)but were still in a straight line and it appeared that they were able to keep perfect distance to each other.  I did not hear any sounds which I though odd. I would have to say that the lights appeared to be slightly lower then the actual stars. The color of the light appear to be white\/sightly yellow. I have never seen anything like this and thought it could be drones or missiles. ((NUFORC Note:  SpaceLink satellites.

From the time one of us took notice and alerted the others, we watched for about 3-5 minutes in the northern sky, moving east to west across until out of sight headed NW about level with the North Star.  No moon in the sky.  A cluster of an estimated 100+ circular, bright bluish white lights with about 20-30 trailing slightly behind the main cluster or formation.  First looked like a glittery ribbon until watching and noticing none were fading out but were moving independently of each other.  Looked similar to balloons but appeared much farther away and fast moving while changing direction and speed, like fish in a school.

It was at first thought to be a parachute but did not have a person or weight attached- and instead of gliding like a parachute, it was advancing steadily through the sky as a plane would.  There was no visible engine nor trails, and it was completely silent.  It appeared to be moving south towards the north at a airplane like speed, and disappeared out of view behind the buildings.","1092":"2 cigar shaped  crafts traveling toward sw 3 lights on each craft . three neighbors sitting on  porch talking  witnessed   two crafts approximately 200 yards long  cigar shaped  estimated 20 foot diameter. with  sorta dim lights 3  on each crafts underside. one front ,one center , and one rear.   They were traveling same elevation as clouds  coming from the northeast ,heading southwest . approximately 200 to 300  miles per hour or about the same speed as an airplane  cruises.  They made no noise at all . They also  appeared to change color from  clouds  color to sky color.  making them blend in with background. they traveled in  one straight line. never changed speed or direction . They did not even come close to any sort  of an aircraft any of us three men had ever seen before. They also  were not  on approach to the nearby mesa,  chandler gateway airport","1093":"A line of lights resembling a snake or worm crawled across the sky At 9:00pm Arizona time myself and the 5 people I was camping with saw a strange light formation crawl across a clear night sky.  It was many lights of varying brightness and size crawling across the sky in a line.  The rest of the camping trip we called it the \"space worm\" because it almost looked like some kind of glowing deep sea worm full of lights. 5 of us saw it and we even woke up the 6th person to make sure we weren't just seeing things.  The only thing we could think of that wouldn't be too crazy is possibly a huge line of satellites, but they were moving to naturally and were much larger and brighter than the other satellites we had seen during the night. It moved like it was alive and some of it's lights blinked on and off with a few trailing behind until it went over the horizon line. ((NUFORC Note:  String of Space Link satellites.

Space ships?) lit up by a beam moving across the night sky, Quartzsite Arizona I was with my boyfriend near Crystal Hill outside of Quartzsite last night.  When we got out of our vehicle to camp, he looked shocked and told me to look up at the sky.  What it looked like was a perfect line of stars moving across the sky in a straight line.  It was about 7-15 small stars in length and there was light hitting the stars illuminating only 3-4 at a time.  The perfectly straight line of stars moved slower than a meteor\/ shooting star and kept moving across the sky.  It seemed faster than a satellite.  Basically it looked like mini space ships\/stars following each other.  The light beam I mentioned earlier would hit a couple of groupings of the stars at a time and followed it as it when across the sky.  This happened at 9:20pm between the pan handle of the Big Dipper and Arcturus, but closer to Arcturus.  It went in between these and kept going in a straight line.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD))","1095":"At approximately 9:30 p.m., I noticed an orange light moving in the night sky.  I could not hear any sounds coming from it.  At the height that it appeared to be, it seemed a lot larger than an airplane.  It continued moving until it changed and got smaller.  Then it disappeared.  It occurred on May 5, 2019, at approximately 9:30 p.m. and lasted 15 or more seconds.","1096":"Straight line literally, of multiple craft at high speed headed north east.  Some with bright lights some with almost no lights.  2 other craft on outside of line keeping far distances.","1097":"My son and I watched it from my 5th floor condo balcony on the beach. It would move sharply, then come to a complete stop and hover for an extended time. It moved quickly to hover over my building. We moved our location for a better view and found ourselves looking under it. It was glowing a pinkish color with a jellyfish type look membrane underneath that seemed to have its own glow in several directions, but all contained underneath the craft.  The craft above the glowing lights was not completely visible due to the night\u2019s sky though an outline was there. It would move at incredible speeds up to St Augustine, then back down the beach, then over to highway 95, and then back over to Marineland.  It came to full stops, hover, then move in a completely opposite direction. Finally it moved north up the coast but never over the water. If it was a drone...then hovering for so long in the sky is new to me. Interesting that there were so many small planes in the sky too, which showed us the height at which it was flying.","1098":"Erratically moving light fading inconsistently in and out above Denver While in our backyard enjoying an evening fire, we noticed a bright light moving from the south, but the light was fading in and out at an inconsistent rate, sometimes fading, sometimes blinking in and out.  As we watched the light moving, it began to slow down, and began moving erratically.  After about 10 minutes, it seemed to turn east, and while its movement east was not consistent, it remained on that general course, the light fading in and out\/blinking in and out the entire time.  It finally grew too distant to see.  This was definitely not an aircraft, since the fading\/blinking was not consistent like an aircraft's warning lights, and was also only white, no green or red light detectable.  The intensity of the light when it was at its brightest reminded me of a satellite when the sun catches it just right, perhaps even brighter.  We did wonder if this was the reported asteroid that was supposed to be at its closest approach tonight, given the inconsistent brightness, but the fact that it fairly quickly changed course to the east, and did not travel in a straight line makes it difficult to pin down.   We do have about 3 minutes of cellphone video of the event, with another star visible for reference.","1099":"Color shifting of several craft in night sky As soon as it gets dark, I see many lights in the sky which rotate thru a color sequence: white, red, green.  They move as if someone is learning how to pilot the craft.  They are too far up for my naked eye to make out a shape and I don\u2019t have the glass to see any better.  They are still there when I go to bed at midnight.  This has been occurring every night for weeks. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly \"twinkling\" stars??

It was still very much light outside.  I saw it fly for about 4 seconds, before it just disappeared.  It was not a plane, or a firework.  I was sitting outside, and I was in perfect view of it.  It left a trace behind it, which disappeared almost instantly.","1115":"Riding down the road and we saw 50-75 flying objects Different shapes the were spread out and all went in single file into the clouds.

I'm a truck driver driving on I-81 south towards Maryland, when I noticed a helicopter.  The first object I knew was a helicopter, cause I saw it fly close by.  Then about ten minutes later, I saw another object in the far distance with a light blinking on the side or near top of it flying towards the interstate where I was driving. I automatically aSsumed it was another helicopter, but noticed even from a far distance the shape of it was weird!.  The sun was about to set completely.  There was still a little bit of sunlight, so it was easier to see what it shockingly was when it flew over me. As the craft flew closer and closer to me on the interstate, I looked at it for a couple of seconds on and off, watching the road at the same time.  The craft was only about 300 feet in the air. It was very close to the ground.  As it finally flew right over the interstate and my semi, I noticed that it was shockingly triangular to diamond shaped and had huge white beam lights on all three to four sides of the craft on, bottom facing the ground.  There was still a little sunlight, so I could see it was definitely not a helicopter or plane that I have ever seen or heard of!  I was only able to look at it flying right under me for about three seconds, cause I had to watch the road.  Even just seeing it those three seconds gives me the chills and goosebumps!!  I continued to look at it from my side mirror on driver's side as it flew behind me until I couldn't see it anymore in my side mirrors.   I was wondering if you'll have anyone else reported seeing this in Wilke Barre, Pennsylvania, area June 26, 201,9 to you'll.  If you would let me know I'd appreciate it!

Witness 1:  About 8:30 p.m. eastern time, I observed a number of objects moving across the sky.  Each object looked like it didn\u2019t have wings and solid red lights on the side and some had solid white lights on the side.  The objects moved across the sky one at a time and it lasted about five minutes.  There were approximately twelve of them, one at a time. Witness 2:  At about 8:15 p.m. eastern time, I observed a silver color object moving across the sky, until I couldn\u2019t see it anymore because it went behind the trees.  I stayed looking into the sky and saw the same object again from where I first had spotted it as if it went backwards.  About 15 minutes after I saw the first object I saw approximately twelve after that but they looked different.  They had solid red lights on the side and some with solid white lights.  They appeared one at a time and the timing between each one seemed to be the same length in time. Witness 3:  At 8:15 eastern time, I was sitting outside with my mom.  I all of a sudden looked at the sky as a flat silver colored object was moving across the sky.  I then pulled out my phone and began taking pictures of the object I was seeing.  This object was flying left in the sky.  I didn\u2019t see it for two seconds and this same silver object now flying left in the sky as if it turned around and started going right.  We then called down my grandfather  and started showing him what we were seeing.  This object had no lights and just looked like a disc.  The pictures we took weren\u2019t coming out well since I was capturing these pictures on my iphone.  All of a sudden several different objects were flying out one after another in the matter of 30 seconds.  They all looked different though, as in different colors around.

At approximately the time and date provided, a loud high pitched jet engine and the sound of the air rushing from the source became suddenly and overwhelmingly audible. This had happened, I state this as a critically important note, a few times before at the location in Five Points, Florida; the low income community in Columbia County that is just a mile or so due North beyond the Lake City city limit if travelling via US441 North. I quickly exited the home located near the county jail on Quentin Street; no surprise befell me when I gazed up to find an impressive looking, but all too familiar, mid sized, jet engine driven aircraft. (I had seen this craft or one almost identical on two other occasions). This craft appeared to my eyes to be quite similar to a harrier jet used by the United States Marine Corps. For the third time over the course of a year I witnessed this craft almost at a standstill but suspended over the area just a few dozen feet North and East of the address in which I was visiting that night. Nothing prior to this event could have prepared me for what occurred within seconds. This night was cloudless the clearest a night could be, but still the craft began to ascend quite rapidly and in less than the proceeding 3 seconds; possibly less as I was completely awe stricken; the craft was gone, though it was just as loud as before. The  even being illuminated on the bottom by 4 bright bluish lights and having some other source of an apparently incandescent orange glow emanating from it the craft completely vanished into a clear night sky leaving behind only the overpowering auditory disturbance of its harrier type turbine. It was approximately one minute before the craft was no longer in range of my ability to hear. Please note that I became extensively educated on the branches of military and all of their publically known weapons systems, vehicles and other various aspects of militaria as an answer to a passion for learning about the history my country. I intended to serve as a soldier in the U.S Army, but a technicality prohibited my enlistment.  I have witnessed many strange occurrences over the last two years most frequently and not exclusively but especially having come to pass in our skies. I fear something sinister and most unpleasant is on the immediate horizon and the number of craft in our skies keeping tabs on us renders us helpless to do anything to avoid submission.

On all occasions I was able to videotape the events. The object moved slowly over going from the south to the northern sky. It would sometimes disappear & then reappear.  I videotaped it the entire time. I could see that it would grow dim & then get brighter.  At approximately 19:52, it grew very bright, then expelled an object.  I thought it looked like red water.  I saw all of this without a telescope, unaided with my own eyes.  The object that was expelled was also red, then dropped straight down & disappeared.  It is visible on my Apple I phone. When I reviewed the video on my phone, I could see the object that was expelled was round & red.  My phone has the ability to enlarge the area & it is clearly round, red, & came out of the original object. The red light then moved more to the north & was level with the trees up the street from my house.  It went behind the trees & didn't reappear.

Object appeared reflective.  Sighting was not discussed with any other crew members or passengers. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Peter I did not mention it to others on the aircraft and the date is accurate within a week or so.  I was actually familiar with the flight crew, as I take this fight many times a month but the cockpit door was closed as we disembarked so the opportunity didn\u2019t exist to discuss.     I don\u2019t want to get into the details of what I do for a living but I fly a lot, sometimes many times a week.  I\u2019m very familiar with most types of aircraft, both civilian and military (and I\u2019ve flow on over 25 types personally).  I\u2019ve seen similar objects on two separate occasions over the last 15-20 years.  Both were metallic spheres, one was a metallic green and the other more red and they seemed to have a slight glow\u2026 and both, I recall, seemed disturbingly close to the aircraft.  Those, if I recall correctly, happened over the mid-west but it was many years ago.  I believe one was near DFW. The recent sighting was the first I\u2019ve had in at least a decade.  The object just seemed to be metallic with no coloration.  But it was an extremely brief sighting. As I mentioned, the disturbing part to me is that these objects are flying, at high speed, well within safe commercial separation.  It\u2019s hard to determine their actual size but maybe something akin to Sputnik.  They seem to have no visible means propulsion or ability to stay aloft (wing surface, stabilizers, etc) nor any other surface breaks, antenna, etc. I\u2019ve always been reluctant to discuss but now that I\u2019m on number three I feel compelled to figure it out.  I brought it up only once prior to a 777 pilot deadheading in a seat next to me but he wasn\u2019t very eager to continue the line of conversation.  If they\u2019re government controlled it\u2019s amazing that such technology exists but, at the same time, seemingly dangerous practice.  Especially over such busy airspace as the Los Angeles Basin.

I had my sight focus on it as we pass a few trees and from a different angle there are now 2 bright silvery glowing objects.  I saw one of the silvery glowing objects separated from another and flew two hundred yards to its right and not a second pass they were gone.","1146":"Bright White orb ufo casually passing by my backyard then disappearing into the sky At approximately 9:48pm on May 30, 2019, as i was getting home from picking up my girlfriend We observed a bright white orb UFO casually moving oddly in the sky above my house slightly to the northeast not very far i say maybe 250-600 yards away from where we were standing in my backyard.  I strangely noticed my camera from my phone was getting slightly out of focus every time i was  trying to stay still and record like as if the ufo was making some kind of electronic scrambling ufo signals towards my phone.  It moved from north to east real fast making absolutely no noise and no blinking, just super bright white orb object weaving and zoning making weird fast movements a commercial aircraft couldn\u2019t do and at the very end it disappeared turning slightly off and on then completely turning off.  Me and my girlfriend were discombobulated after it disappeared.  It also affected us emotionally like it sent out some kind of stealth ufo signals towards us making us feel out of place for 2-3 hours.

I was on a red light.  Moved to the next red light Craft was in same spot.  I pulled in to my house.  Ran to front door and looked for it.

We watched it over","1150":"Newark, NY, solid dark sphere with orange\/red light on front. We watched a dark ball shaped craft with a single steady orange\/red light on front approach us while boating on the Erie Canal in Newark, NY.  I shined a bright flashlight at it and it turned back the way it came.  No noise, no wings, no anti collision lights.   It flew about 1000 feet in the air.  It maintained the same speed and height for the duration we could see it.  It flew as close as a quarter mile from us before turning back.","1151":"5 bright red oval or squared object hover then accend at extreme speed over San Clemente, CA. I witnessed 5 separate dark but bright red objects follow the same trajectory.  The first followed by the next.  I spotted them about the height you would see a helicopter approaching towards you.  Then stopped for a milli second before heading up at about a 60 degree angle at an extremely high rate of speed.  I watched each accend until they went out of sight, which took 3 to 5 seconds. The last object followed the same path but was a bit slower in speed. There was no sound other lights or trail.  These were definately seperate distinct objects moving in the same deliberate path. I have never seen anything before that I would descrbe as a \"UFO\".   Also, I observed these immediately following the 7.1 earthquake which hit about 150 miles north in Ridgecrest Ca. My girlfriend caught a video of one but it does not capture what we saw visually.  I describe them as \"light\".  She says they were more squared or rectangled.","1152":"My husband and I were sitting outside the Atlantic Inn on Block Island, New Shoreham, Rhode Island  at 10:13 PM on Saturday, July 6, 2019.  We were at a high elevation facing north north west.   I turned to my right to speak to my husband and I saw a white glowing object approaching him from behind at a incredibly fast speed, I said, \"Oh, my God,\" and he looked up and saw the object pass over his head and we watched it zoom out of sight straight away from us in the north north west direction.  Its trajectory would\u2019ve had it aiming toward Charlestown, Rhode Island.  It was about 2000 feet off the ground and I believe it to be about 20 foot diameter.  It was round in shape, it was completely glowing white, it was silent, flew by at  incredible speed.  We were at high enough elevation that I saw it come toward me from the far horizon and saw it disappear at the opposite horizon.  Its trip across the entire sky took less than two seconds.  I would estimate it flew at 5000 ! mph, given that I know jets fly around 500 mph. It was the fastest thing I had ever seen in flight.    I am certain it was not a private plane, drone, commercial jet, weather balloon, or shooting star.  I think it was awfully low to the ground to be some government equipment.  Wondering if anyone else saw anything.","1153":"I was pulling into my driveway around 10:20pm.  In the southern sky, I noticed a bright orange ball I the sky.  It was moving very slowly.  Almost hovering.  If made no sound. It was brighter than any star.  I called my fiancee to come outside.  She was speechless.  The craft continued to move South.  We watched it until it disappeared.

Checking my security cameras the next morning, I noticed a small linear shape hovering close to my daughter's room.  The image looked like it has 5 lights.  I spent a number of hours looking at mini-drone\/personal drone models, but could find none even remotely similar to the flying micro object.   We live in rural Florida and the minute long video I am emailing shows no one in the area is even awake or out and about.  This is not a typical \"flying saucer\" in the sky moving quickly, etc., but it is an anomaly.  I am inquiring to see if there are other such occurrences.   Thank you.

My family was enjoying a night of sitting outside and watching a small fireworks show we\u2019d planned.  Our attention was on the nearly direct west-side of the night sky.  About twenty minutes into our firework-watching, we noticed what looked like very distant, bronze-toned lights which were flying in perfect unison\u2014making what looked like an enlongated triangle formation.  There were four lights, total.  One light made the point of the enlongated triangle, then two more lights, perfectly spaced, which made the bottom of the \u201ctriangle\u201d formation.  There was, at a distance behind the formation, one more bronze-ish toned light.  This light was exactly like the other three, but appeared to fly at its own pace, and was not part of the formation.  The \u201ctriangle\u201d and independent light were headed southbound and seemed to be traveling at a slow rate, almost at times appearing at a stand still.  The triangle formation stayed that shape for about five minutes.  The light that h! ad been trailing behind independently suddenly \u201cdashed\u201d off at such a fast rate that the only way to describe it is to compare it with a shooting star.  But between six sober, adult eye witnesses, it can be said, without a doubt, that the bronze-colored light that zoomed off was not a shooting star.  It was definitely a light on some sort of flying craft that had \u201cshot off\u201d in the opposite direction it had been traveling, and then completely disappeared from sight. The other three lights disappeared from sight as well only seconds afterwards, but unlike the independent light that had been trailing, these just \u201cwent out\u201d and nothing more of them was seen. These lights were not bright white like search helicopter lights, and they were not white, nor blinking, like those seen at night on commercial aircraft.  These lights were small, bronze, round in shape, and stayed constantly on until their sudden disappearance from the night sky.  The night sky was clear, with no cloud coverage at the time.","1156":"Very bright blue\/white piont of light that stopped for a moment, then continued northeast.

I was on my balcony, about 50 feet from the ground, i saw one bright red object that looked to be a ball shape.  It was giving off a glow that was so red it looked to be blurry to my eyes, if that makes sense.  I could see it above the tree line, approximately 3 miles away, east.  Within 5 seconds it was hovering right over me.  It's flight patterns in the sky was unlike anything I've ever seen.  It moved in circles, it would hover low, then back up high again repeatedly.   Once the object decided to stop hovering above me, It was out of my eye sight in a matter of seconds,  I watched it until it left. It felt as if I was staring at it for a very long time (probably because I was awe) but it was only a minute.  I've never seen anything like this,  I'm a UFO sceptic but I saw something, something that wasn't of this Earth and I cannot explain to myself, so I'm here posting this.  I just wish other would've saw it too.  It was beautiful. I felt very calm and relaxed the ! whole time.  I wish to see it again soon. Unfortunately, I didn't take a photo.

It moved slow and wobbled.  Wind meanwhile prevailing wind was coming from the south east at 7 mph.  Frogs in near by lake stopped crooking and no aircraft where in area at that time.

Within seconds of noticing the orbs, the craft flew over us, it was so close I felt like I could touch it, it flew within 100ft of the plane, we couldn't hear any noise. The craft that passed over us was about as 100ft in size, long triangular shape, grey coloured in the middle and darker grey on the skirting of the craft.  There was 1 white coloured orb in each corner of the craft which didn't emit any light.  The craft was completely smooth, no panels, no wording on the craft.  Lastly there was what appeared to be an LED flash in each corner of the craft as it went past, the top of the triangle was flashing green, the bottom right was flashing green and the bottom left was flashing red.  It appeared these \"LEDs\" were attached to the side of craft, it also looked about 30 stories high in height. I've never seen anything move so quick and so close to a passenger plane, it caused no threat but it was still terrifying to see so closely.

On the evening of 3 June, 2019, 3 adults, a 10-year old and a 6-year old observed 4 craft hover and maneuver over the town of Patagonia, Arizona, for 2 hours. The evening was dark (new moon), no haze and cloudless.  You could see the streak of the Milky Way arcing through the sky. The sighting started at around 2030, my Mom and I were sitting in the back yard talking.  All of a sudden, my Mom exclaimed, \"Look at that Airliner!\"  I turned, and looking east-southeast towards Red Mountain, was a light traversing from left to right, about 30-degrees above the horizon.  At first glance, it would be easily be mistaken for an aircraft strobe...but the flash pattern was too fast, almost flickering.  As we looked, the craft slowed, stopped, and then started moving the exact opposite direction.  I ran to the fence, and as I watched, it slowed and started hovering. Perfectly motionless.  I called my Mom to go get my Cousins and to bring binoculars. About 30 seconds later, she arrived at the fence with my Older cousin, her two kids, aged 10 and 6, and the binoculars. Looking through the binoculars, I observed a large red ball-like light on the right with two flickering\/strobing lights to left.  While I was looking, the ball changed color from red to blue, and started moving straight up.  All of us exclaimed in amazement.  After moving up for 5 seconds, it moved left, stopped and hovered, and then started moving in random motions, frequently stopping to hover motionlessly for up to 30 seconds at a time. At this time, my 10-year old cousin yelled, \"There's another one!\".  Looking to the left, there was another craft like the first one, moving towards the first.  I then asked my older cousin to try and record with her phone camera.  As the night was very dark, all she could pick up was the intense strobe. After about 30 minutes of the two craft maneuvering, 2 more appeared.  These 4 craft moved all over the sky, stopping and hovering, moving in diagonals, and going straight up in the air to very high altitudes.  They would cycle through many colors:  Red, Blue, Orange, Green, White and Purple. My Mom observed a slight aura or haze around the objects, which I couldn't see. Object number #1 at times stopped, and the \"colored\" ball moved to the center of a ring of lights that flashed in sequential pattern, then reconfigured to the Ball left\/flashing lights right pattern. There was no noise of jet engines or helicopter blades the entire time. At times, my 10-year old cousin actually sat in the grass to watch these things. These were not meteors, satellites, drones or aircraft (planes\/helicopters). I am an IT specialist, US Army veteran with a hobby of photographing aircraft.

This was not a reflection or water drop or anything else but a well measured out craft with well measured out features in even distances from each other. The picture was taken with my new iPhone In live mode so it captures a three second video combined with a still photo and when I swiped to see the picture I could see this was moving like a blue laser pen wiggling on a wall moving all over the place up down back-and-forth never in a straight line or flight path. I downloaded the app called Lifey it allows you to take these live shots and save them as a MOV file to see the video and what I saw is incredible! this craft moves all over the place like a pinball never in a straight path it moves up down backwards sideways forwards diagonal just like if you were to wiggle a laser light on a wall.

Didn\u2019t leave a tail or streak but was very, very bright.  It almost looked like a large star. The sun hadn\u2019t set yet and it was still very bright in the area.  No sound or shape of a jet or human made aircraft.","1198":"At around 21:00 pm Chicago time, In Oshkosh, WI at Utica Golf course. A friend and I were standing in the parking lot watching 2 very large orb things in the sky. They looked like very large, very bright balls of light.  It started as 2. They were weaving in and outside of each other, and came to complete stops just hovering in the sky.  At one point they seemed to have \u201ccollided\u201d and formed one object.  They broke apart shortly after and began a decent to the earth.  One was turning on and off, almost looking like it was dipping in and outside of the clouds.  One disappeared and the other continued a zig zagged decent behind the tree line.  We have the entire encounter recorded.","1199":"Bright orange orb moving from south to north, then stopped and brightness slowly faded to dark.   About thirty seconds later, saw orb reappear slightly northeast of last location gradually gaining brightness.  It moved westward until out of sight.

At approximately 03:10, which could very well be 04:10, due to the one hour time difference, I was on my balcony, at which time I noticed a fluorescent green circular object penetrate the oceans depths and rise to cloud level.  This object had what appeared to be amber yellow\/orange flames around the object.  The flames emulating the outer surface of a circular saw, and glistened as if burning.

It was approximately 3 miles away.","1204":"Glowing orange orb dropping burning flares out of it, straight down to the ground. Looking to the east, toward the banning pass, Mt. San Jacinto area, I saw a glowing orange orb like a fireball hovering constant in the sky.  While other air traffic with flashing lights passed, the orb stayed in place and began dropping what looked like flares of the same color straight down out of it.  Dozens dropped out and they disappeared as if disintegrating toward the ground.  The event lasted about a minute, and the orb then faded from view.","1205":"I saw a light above Dobbins Air Force Base in Marietta, GA, that was 10 times as bright as any star in the sky and 5 times as bright as a plane, was also about 3 times the size of what a plane would be.

This happened for a total of three lights and then they completely disappeared.","1206":"Thick blue beam of light coming from the sky. I was watching the lighting storm from my living room window on the south hill in Spokane on 53rd street, while my girlfriend was in the bathroom.  There was a large volume of lightning.   All of a sudden I saw a blue beam of light shoot down from the sky at a 45 degree angle, and it was thick.  It was about a 7 foot wide beam of light and I was approximately 1000 feet relative to the event.  There's no way I could be the only person who saw this.   It didn't look like any light any person could have possibly owned.  This thing shot way up into the clouds and was intense.  It remained a solid beam of light for approximately 20 seconds and then disappeared.  This was absolutely not lightning by any chance whatsoever.  I know what lightning looks like.  This was CLEAR.","1207":"I was taking out the garbage at around 9:45 p.m. what's my daughter who is 11 years old.  I saw a red light up in the sky with two white lights falling around it.

It stayed stationary for 1-2 minutes, then moved at an extremely slow speed moving from east to west.   I lost sight of it once it hit the clouds in the distance.

Approx. train location when the sighting started: https:\/\/www.openstreetmap.org\/#map=14\/50.394\/2.9795    Sun:  It was just after 20:00 and the day was pretty clear, I was traveling towards south, and the sighting happened towards east\/northeast, as the train moved away.  The sun was in the opposite side of the train from where I saw the UFO. Weather:  Sparse clouds with noticeable movement because of the wind. Velocity:  The train was traveling at more than 100Km\/h and less than 160Km\/h, judging from nearby highway traffic observed later in the trip. Sighting:  I was traveling in a seat facing the opposite direction of train movement, and first observed the object in the closest distance in the entire sighting.  I noticed a white, long object (slimmer than an airliner) with an apparent size that for me at first felt like a bus- sized object. As I was moving my point of view along with the train, the object always seemed static, staying above the same place. No other aircraft was seem during the sighting, but later on I saw airplanes and their movement is very discernible. As I moved away I could see only its \u2018front\u2019, \u2018round\u2019 side, that reflected very well the light of the sun allowing for me to see it for more 4-5Kms.  This view was partially obscured by thin clouds, so my notion of initial size can be wrong.  As I moved away it became a shining white dot. I lost sight after the train track got lower than ground level in a ditch, and made a curve toward Arras.","1213":"an elongated and dark centered orb appeared and shot across the night sky before stopping short and disappearing.

Well this night upon awakening I saw a lot of stars as I was turning away I saw movement. Looking closer I saw movement.  Moving the speed of a plane (being a F-14 mechanic in the Navy), these star shaped objects reached the south side of Mt. Lassen and started doing curly Q's and half moons then disappeared.   I am used to counting geese fly over so pretty sure of the number.

I was stargazing one night from my backyard patio.  Dim orange\/red intermittent illumination round object traveling across the sky from West to East.  No navigation lights as planes I did notice transiting that night so I ruled out the possibility of the sighting being an airplane.  It was noticed first as what I thought was a shooting star in my peripheral vision but it never burned out but got dim and traveled in a zig zag pattern across the sky.  I tried to track it with my eyes until it suddenly disappeared.","1218":"Luminous white light; not a drone, airplane, helicopter or blimp in NYC. The original time\/dated stamped video is on my wife's iPhone.  We own an apartment on the 16th floor of a residential high-rise building in Astoria that overlooks the East River and the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge.  I was not at the apartment.  My wife and her mom were at the apartment.  My wife was trying out new clothes in the bedroom.   She looked out the window when her eyes were caught by a white-light, oval in shape.  She initially taught that it was a spy-drone but she commented to herself that \u201cit was bigger than any drone she\u2019s ever seen\u201d.  Upon her closer look the light seemed to wobble in place.   My wife felt that she was watched\u2014you know the feeling, we\u2019ve all experienced someone looking at you while stopped at the red light and both drivers turn at the same time to look at each other.   My wife pointed this light out to her mom as she dressed and ran to get her cellphone and film from the balcony; that is when the video started.  It captures 10-seconds of this light that moved to a greater distance across the river, in the matter of seconds my wife ran for the phone.  As soon as the video started, as if the object knew it was being recorded or read my wife\u2019s mental intention, it took off into the horizon fairly quickly.  Faster than any drone, helicopter or airplane could perform such a feat.  I rule out a drone due to the amount of light it emitted drones have to conserve their limited battery power.   Drones are not legal to fly in NYC.  The sun had already set so it was not light reflecting off any object.   From our apartment, every year, there is a fireworks which precedes the bigger show hosted by Macy\u2019s every year.  The area flocks with thousands of people.  From our balcony we have a vantage point to view the show.  My point is that last year someone flew a drone to capture images of the fireworks and from our balcony we, and independently others, could clearly hear and visually track the drone with the blinking! red\/blue lights and prop-noise.  The drone would fly close to! the river, climb up to about 300 feet fly around and dive again.  We\u2019ve seen drones in other parts of the City and we are knowledgeable of them.   Living near LaGuardia Airport we are used to airplanes.  Living in the City we are used to helicopters and the rare blimp.  This was not the normal route of either.  This object, my wife and her mom said, was totally silent.  It was uniform in light; no multi-colored blinking or solid lights.  Again, NO SOUND!   In 18 years living at the apartment and over 30 years living in NYC this is the first time anything like this has ever happened.","1219":"Rectangular very bright and big green object seen over Madison, Alabama On the night of June 15, 2019, I went to my backyard and walk to the middle and something like a very far, distant noise made me to turn my head to the sky, completely over my head. As I was looking, I realize it was a very bright and intense green light coming from an big object or whatever it was.  I looked at intervals during 1 or 2 minutes, and then suddenly, I understood that something was not right, because it was big, kind of square and it didn\u2019t move. So I continued looking, went inside, came back, and it was still there, just over me.  I went inside again and thought that I should take a picture, but I didn\u2019t want to leave it alone and loose it maybe.  So I came back again to the backyard and it was still there, not moving.  I could feel some kind of energy. This time I went inside and grabbed my iPhone, and I focused over my head looking directly to the \u201cobject\u201d.  In the instant I took the picture the \u201cbig object\u201d moved in a fraction of second to the right and just disappeared.

It stayed still for over a minute then sped towards direction of fireworks.  It looked much higher than the fireworks.  Then, sped to left and shot back in the opposite direction going higher until couldn\u2019t see it. 5 minutes later it returned to a nearby spot in the sky and moved about in the same manner.  Towards the end of the 23 minute show, another craft appeared.  It was triangular with a light on each tip..one red, one white, and one blue.  This was nowhere near the fireworks and the lights did not flash like an airplane.  There are airports nearby but this did not look like a plane.  It was high up too.  The police had heavy security for the fireworks snd had been using a drone earlier and it was unlit and had a distinct noise.  There was no noise coming from either of these objects.

I was standing in my backyard when I noticed it moving across the north west portion of the sky, in the direction of Mt. Charleston.  My home is a considerable distance from Mt. Charleston, so I assume it would have been a significantly large object for it to be seen from several miles away.  It did not change direction or appear to speed up or slow down and made  a consistent line across the sky. Even though it was roughly 8pm, there was still a decent amount of daylight; the sun hadn\u2019t completely set.  I observed the object for approximately 5 minutes before it was obscured first by neighboring buildings and then finally by the mountain itself.","1227":"Flickering lights at edges of what appeared to be a triangle form.

Was on back porch trying to get a look at Saturn.  Flashing white light came across sky from basically East to West.  Did not discern anything other than the light but the light was 5-6 times bigger than the surrounding stars.  It was flashing at roughly 1 flash per second.  Appeared to be low in sky and was in view for approximately 5-6 seconds.  Thought at the time it was a satellite but checked one of the websites and there were no satellites scheduled to fly over.   No idea what it was but it was moving fast and silently.  Wife was on the porch with me but looking thru binoculars and did not see object.  Was not a lightning bug as I could clearly see the white color, lightning bugs are yellow. Not saying extra-terrestrial, just something I never saw before.","1231":"A white large round object followed by bright Green then bright Blue light moving fast across the sky over Durango Colorado My sighting was on 7-8-2019 at around 10:00 PM on a clear night over United Campground in Durango Colorado,  My wife saw this with me, moving from East toward West was a round large glowing object.  It had no defined outer perimeter and was  as large as if you held a dime coin about 15 foot from you..  It moved across the sky in about 15 seconds at what appeared to be  maybe 10,000 ft altitude and there was no sound. Shortly after that an airplane was following it but was not as fast. Then to our amazement a very bright green steady light came across the sky on the same path but faster,  That was not the final sighting,  Then a bright Blue light came across the sky on the same course. None of these lights had any blinking marker lights except for the chasing airplane,  We watch the sky most nights looking at satellites etc,  None of this was normal.

In the sky over Huntsville or Redstone Arsenal, I noticed 2 bright yellowish lights and one blinking red light and did not hear any airplane or helicopter noise.  The yellowish lights appeared to be moving slowly, very close but in different directions.  After about 30 seconds they disappeared (not simultaneously, but separately).   It might have been some kind of a firework trail the way they faded from view, but it took a full 30 seconds for them to disappear and neither light moved downward.   After they were gone, I watched the blinking red light move toward the southwest over Redstone Arsenal toward the Huntsville Airport for an additional 30 seconds until it was obstructed from my view by a large tree.  I continued watching for 10 minutes but never saw the bright yellowish lights or the red blinking light again.  If I were to guess, I would suspect either some satellite-related event or two helicopters that turned on and off their lights too far away for me to hear them.  I suspect the red blinking light was a satellight","1233":"My wife and we\u2019re in our hot tub, stargazing and plane spotting as we normally do when we observed what appeared to be either a string of lights or a plane pulling lights.

It was fairly long in duration, meaning 15-20 seconds.  The lights being pulled varied in intensity, either from their own light or from reflected sunlight even though the sun had set a couple of hours earlier.

It was directly overhead in the dark sky with no clouds.  The lights were in a perfectly straight line and brightened intermittently.  Some lights near the front, middle, or end would become brighter; sometimes one, two, or three showing brightly at the same time with no apparent sequence.  The lights were all spaced apart evenly.  The line of lights seemed to appear out of nowhere, moved across the sky in a straight line, then one after another disappeared as though they were vanishing into a spot in the sky.

Was driving south on Miami and stopped at the intersection with Ewing.  Saw this object flying straight down the road headed north at about 40 mph.  Was maybe 5-10 feet long, about a foot wide.  Could not see color siliouted against the sky, but was uniform and dark.   No wings, very familiar with birds, too large as well.  Could see it coming from several blocks to the south and it passed directly over my car.  I whipped my head around and saw it continue to the north until I lost sight of it, unchanging in altitude or direction.  Got a pretty good look as it passed maybe 15-20 feet straight over my windshield and believe me I was leaning over the dash to track it.  There is no way I am the only one who saw it.  Was a nice morning and lots of cars were out.  Hope to see another report, maybe someone got a pic.  Was all to fast for me to get one.","1248":"MADAR Node 121","1249":"At about 10am this morning something crossed the entire sky and went over our house in roughly 2 seconds.  It woke me from a dead sleep as it was very loud and fast, sounding similar to a snowplow scraping the road but at a ridiculous speed, everything rumbled.    Approximately 45 minutes later, the same event occurred traveling the opposite direction.  I ran to the window immediately and saw nothing and the immensely loud sound was gone, as fast as it happened.   Multiple jets were flying around the area in the hours that followed, but I cannot stress enough that this was unlike any jet or anything else that I've ever heard fly overhead.  The speed at which it crossed the sky was unbelievable.   I checked with a friend down the street and he verified that he heard this as well .

I thought that from being in the sun for a long time, maybe my eyes were getting adjusted to the lighting outside as it was sundown.   My friend said, omg, do you see that and my other friend said she seen them too, so were walking wondering what in the world it could be as there was no buildings, towers or anything around we were literally walking back through a corn field, and I jokingly said it's like a ufo...the aliens are watching us.   Just then my girlfriend turned around and said omg it's a UFO... myself and other friend turned around and there was a triangle shape VERY bright light of some sort with a trail behind it, it was not a plane, jet, helicopter or like anything ANY of us have ever seen before, and it was around for about 20 minutes or so and vanished.","1253":"The craft appeared from the direction of the ocean and they were the brightest lights ive ever seen in my life, bright orange, blazing and large not high like stars, but just above in the sky.   The first craft turned off his light and as it moved on slowly away north, I could see its dark silhouette in the still light evening sky. It was a dark craft and it had mechanical looking structure on the top.  It looked larger than a large jet.  I saw at least seven.  I could hear no sounds of engines.","1254":"At first I saw pulsating lights headed west board that lit up every second leaving a slight visual echo for a total of 5 times.  Then from the south, came a small orb.  Seemed to very high in the sky, it proceeded north until it suddenly then followed the other craft west bound. This one was much slower.  It would pause briefly.  It would also do a small circle and then proceed onwards.

It is a beautiful clear sky day.  We were driving from Alloa towards Alva when something high up flashed in the sun and caught my eye as well as one of my passengers.  Then the 2nd passenger saw it.  It was very large, rectangular and appeared to light up around the edges although that could have been from the sun.  It was almost blurred around the object making me think it almost had an aura.  It moved very very fast and travelled end over end.  I would estimate the height to be between 30k and 40k feet which would have made the craft around the size of a football pitch.  You could hear no noise whatsoever.   I am an aviation reporter and enthusiast and I have seen just about every vehicle that flies.  This thing was huge and unlike anything encountered before.","1259":"3 black circles fell out of the sky.  Hovered then spiraled down with a smoke trail.","1260":"Shiny silver disk or saucer over Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, then disappeared Pittsburgh, PA. June 28, 2019:  I walked outside in my backyard to take my dog out at around 8:35 PM.  I could sense a storm coming over my way so I looked up into the clouds and noticed a super bright object.  The grey clouds were out in the distance, and the shiny object was right overhead.  It caught my eye at first glance - that\u2019s how shiny it was.  I stared at it for five minutes and realized it could not have been a star nor a plane.  It was located way too high in the sky for it to have been a plane.  I\u2019ve seen both of those things during a sunset and neither of those were what I witnessed. I was watching the object, which looked exactly like a UFO, for 15 minutes straight.  It was a shiny silver color, and it looked horizontally elongated, like a disk.  It did not move. At about 8:50 PM, I saw the shiny object disappear into plain sight.  Again, it didn\u2019t move or anything when I saw it fade away.  It\u2019s like it camouflaged itself right into the color of the sky.  I did not see it after that.","1261":"Shiny white pill-shaped object moving at various speeds before disappearing A white pill shaped object very high in the sky, much higher than several planes crossing the sky also.  It was at times stationary,  and at times moving slowly.  It was present for around 30 minutes before fading from sight suddenly.","1262":"White or translucent\/oscillating donut shaped UFO observed hovering for 5 minutes before vanishing Walking back to my house from my barn, I observed a round, white object hanging in the near sky above my house.  I estimate the distance to be several thousand feet up in the air.  A jet had passed over about 5 minutes before and was very high in the sky, unlike the object.  It was high, but not like a plane. The object was bright white, or white-translucent, or oscillating.  The shape was circular with a hollow center, like a donut.  Also, it seemed to be hanging in the air at an angle, like you would tilt a hat on your head \u2013 it wasn\u2019t horizontal.  Direction was North, I live at the 45th parallel in what locals call \u2018Northwest Lower Michigan\u2019. The object was hanging in the air and there was no sound, and I observed it for 2 minutes when I went inside my house to get binoculars.  The binoculars revealed a closer look at the object, which I estimate to be the size of a minivan.  I watched the object, switching between unassisted eyesight and the binoculars for 5 minutes.  Towards the end of the time I observed the object, a single red light appeared on its West facing side.  I returned to my house to lay the binoculars down, and when I returned a moment later, the craft was gone. I telephoned the local Coast Guard at approximately 11:30PM the same evening, who told me \u201cthey hadn\u2019t seen anything\u201d and advised me to call the police.  I telephoned the police non-emergency the next morning (today) and was met with similar disinterest and doubt. I Google searched \u2018donut shaped UFOs\u2019 and came across a NASA link that looks very much like what I believe I saw:   https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/science\/617569\/WATCH-Now-International-Space-Station-spots-bizarre-donut-UFO-that-vanishes   The weather last night was clear and warm, it was still light and no stars had yet appeared","1263":"I was in a field having a bonfire.  I looked through the fire and thought I was looking at 2 bright embers.  I stepped aside so the fire was not in my direct line of site.  I witness two bright lights roughly 1 foot apart in the night sky if you were to hold up a ruler.  They were traveling towards each other at a very fast rate.  They passed within an in of each other (again using the concept of holding a ruler to the night sky) this fact convinced me that they were no terrestrial aircraft because of the proximity they were to each other in passing.   After they passed each other the lights vanished entirely after about 2-5 seconds.  This happened between Saturn and Jupiter in the night sky on a summer evening.

I thought it was strange to see either\/or in daylight and questioned out loud to my partner about that.   We drove past a short line of trees, that took approximately less than a minute to drive past, and when we were at a point to see the sky again, the light was gone.  It had just disappeared.  Given that it appeared stationary when first observed, it was highly unlikely that it had moved beyond the line of sight in such a short period of time at the speed that would have been necessary to do so.  I was unable to find the light again after that.","1270":"Circular craft with bluish\/white light shining out horizontally over Los Angeles County, CA, at 1:00AM A small bright, bluish dot came up over my house as I sat in my backyard hot tub.  I stargaze out there almost every night so I am well accustomed to airplanes, helicopters, shooting stars, and satellites sightings.  At first I thought his object was simply a bright satellite as it was tracking in a smooth slow trajectory up over my house in an area of sky where I usually spot satellites as they traverse at night. It was after about 10 seconds of observation that I witnessed the small bright object pause, then continue slowly, then pause and hover again.  This told me it was definitely not a satellite and had to be a craft of some sort.  It then continued forward but made a slow \"S\" shaped squiggle of its flight path unlike any airplane, drone, or helicopter would generally execute.  It paused once more and then began to get brighter.  I realized it was descending from a much higher altitude to a lower one.  It was not quite directly over me at this point but very near vertical as far as the angle at which I had to look up.  Once it got low enough I could distinctly see it was circular and convex on the bottom, perhaps a sphere, but possibly more flattened.  Color was black or dark gray from what I could make out.  The bright light was not on the bottom but rather pointing out horizontally from one side. I was a brilliant white\/bluish hue and did not flicker or blink at all as an aircraft lights might.  No sound was audible from it. I observed the object hovering at this lower altitude of roughly 750-1000 feet up for about 5 minutes. I ran inside after that point to grab my camera.  It was still present when I returned but had ascended much higher. I attempted to get a picture but it was too hard to get a clear focus as it continued to ascend and then the light faded out suddenly and it was gone. I have been stargazing for years now and have never seen something I couldn't ID as I am familiar with all kinds of aircraft, satellites, and shooting stars that frequent the night sky. This was something very different and I cannot figure out what it was other than a definite flying object with a circular profile when viewed looking up from the ground.

Until 15 min later around 1030pm, I seen the flash again. This time it looked like it was the color red, and it seemed to have lit up the sky above the tree line. I am 24 years old, I know what lightning looks like.  It was weird that it seemed to have the brightest parts in the same spot each time closest to the trees.  It flashed about 10-15 times at 1030, and I didnt see it again the rest of the night. I thought it could have been a storm approaching, and thought I could have imagined it being a reddish  color.  When I looked up current radar of the area on my phone, I didnt see anything near the area, my thoughts went straight to this show I watched.  It showed a flash of light in the sky lighting it up from near the ground.  All I can think of that would have been this, was something paranormal. Hope someone else saw what I had last night.

I spotted an odd, flat profile object moving right to left (West to East, roughly) straight across my windshield field of vision.  The object moved extremely slowly, even slower than the aircraft I see landing and taking off every day as I drive near Syracuse Hancock International Airport.  I also see Air Force drones flying all the time, as our base at Hancock Field trains Drone pilots for the Air Force. The object was white to a flat light gray, uniform in color.  It looked like a dime flat in profile, without striations on the edge.

At times, I even noticed it split into multiple orbs.  3 of stood there in awe and watched it for 45 minutes to an hour as it moved side to side and forward and backward changing in brightness drastically.  It's color at times appeared to be all colors, like how light can diffract into a rainbow through water.  It gave us all chills as it appear to be watching us for a bit.  I got a video in which side to side movement is hard to tell because of my shaky hands, but it is clear that it went from an invisible distance and came close and bright and then back to invisible distance.  The movement was highly irregular which rules out any rocket based aircraft.  It had an aura around it that glowed, as it had constant light emission that was very bright.  After my friends went home (it was m! idnight at this point), I stayed outside and watched until after 1am and it kept leaving and coming back every few minutes the entire time.

I was walking my dog and noticed what I initially thought was a round, ring-like balloon floating in the sky.  But then I noticed that it didn't continue to drift.  Instead it moved slowly and in different directions and at one point even paused.  It continued to move very slowly and deliberately through the sky, as if observing.","1298":"Strange lights in Southeast Arizona. Six strange lights in a \u201cW\u201d formation flashing several variation of colors began to do sporadic movements in the sky.  They divided into sets of two, some going north, some going south and some going west.  At some point 2 of them shot back towards the east and then joined into one orbit and then simply vanished.  Approximately 15 minutes later two very large red orbs appeared flashing simultaneously.  They were several miles apart but clearly at the exact same height and very much in sync!  Then disappeared as if to just fade away.","1299":"Bright orange flash ball then just faded away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I have been seeing lights above my house at night.  A lot of the time I think it could be a star.  BUT they seem to have 3 lights not one and will move around..up and down.  Over and back. Sometimes moving across sky fast and other times seem to disappear.  I have only lived in this house in Rockland for less then a year.  Since the beginning of the summer this has happened quite a few times.  Tonight I saw 2 Bigger ones then I have in the past couple months.  They had 3 Rows of lights..red n yellow or white..  Directly above me and it seemed to drop down and move til gone....the second larger one with 3 rows of lights followed almost Exact SAME PATH.  One right after the other.  Then behind that 2 more smaller lights.  I did not see where in the sky it started from but there was a strange trail of lights near the moon...heading close to where it looked to be coming from.  My boyfriend was outside with me.  He has also seen these other lights on occasion and these tonight.  We have an 8 year old daughter. Have been together for 15 years.  We are both in our mid 30s.  I have never noticed anything like these lights before. and as people have harsh opinions and are very skeptical I have not yet reported these. Been doing a little research, as well.  I, however, continue to see them....and tonight the 2 were larger then before.  Or closer.  After the second larger one was no longer over head but had dropped down to be closer to the tree line yet further away I saw flashing lights back towards the moon n another right behind that.  Maybe they are planes. I don't think so though.  Maybe the second set was...  I honestly don't know and am going to continue to watch.","1301":"2 possible crafts above Union City, TN Let me start by saying I did not see the first craft, only the way a cloud reacted.  The second was a flash further south above the clouds moving in the same direction as the first. I was standing in the back door of my home smoking and looking up at the moon.  I noticed a small cloud (back lit by the moon) seem to change and it caught my attention.  It seemed to swirl for a moment and then strung out toward the north-west. I thought nothing of it at first and brushed it off as strange weather. Looking farther south now, where a storm seemed to be brewing, accompanied by lightning flashes, I saw a strange flash (oblong above the clouds and not in the same area as the lightning.)  The flash seemed to move toward the same direction as the first phenomenon. This really got my attention. Suddenly my right hand, the right side of my neck, and my right ear felt hot.  This lasted for maybe 10 seconds then faded.  After this I felt sick and had to close the door and rush to the bathroom.  As soon as I left the back door however the feeling passed.  This feeling has never happened to me before but has left me shaken.","1302":"Several fireball lights seen by husband and wife in Arizona My husband and I were driving through the desert on our way home from Flagstaff and I looked up and saw probably six fireball-type lights in the sky and I pointed at them and asked my husband if he could see those, too.  He said they were definitely there, I wasn\u2019t just imagining things.  They were circular, in a mostly straight line, but a couple of them were a little higher than the other ones.  Once one disappeared, another would appear on the other side.  We saw it for a few seconds, and it disappeared.  One light went out, then the next, and so on until it was all out, but that happened within like a second.  It went out as soon as I told my husband to grab his phone and take a video, as if it could hear us, or see us.  So, since it disappeared, we forgot about the phone for a moment and talked about what we just saw and it came up again, doing the same thing, only a shorter amount of time that time.","1303":"Looked out the window around 10:00pm after hearing a loud boom and saw a bright triangular light hovering also saw multiple pulsating lights circling the triangular light.

As soon as I looked at it, it moved in a straight line at a high rate of speed, and then vanished after traveling roughly 100 feet.   While moving, the object looked like a shooting star, but was only about 60 feet above the ground.  It made no noise.","1305":"We were outside, 11:54pm, saw 4 lights moving east at the bottom of  the big dipper.  As they moved, two more lights joined the line.

They both reported that it was strange, and kind of eerie.  When I suggested they may have seen a UFO, they both laughed at me and scoffed.

Over the Memorial Day weekend, my friend and I were camping a state park north of Grand Marais, and at about 12:19 am on Sunday, May 26, we both saw something in the sky that appeared unusual, and which was not obviously something man-made (plane, etc.) or a natural phenomenon like a bird, clouds, etc.  The sky was clear and full of stars, and the view from our campsite was mostly unobstructed except for some pine trees.  We had a good view of the west\/northwest and west\/southwest part of the sky. We were sitting around the campfire talking, and at a lull in our conversation, I was gazing at a bright stationary object near the Big Dipper.  I stared at it for a few moments, because it was so bright.  At first I thought it was a planet.  I began thinking that it wasn\u2019t a planet I was familiar with because it was near the Big Dipper, and I didn\u2019t think that was normal.   Then, suddenly it began to move on a straight track from the west\/northwest to a point higher in the sky above us, generally in the west\/southwest direction, but still fairly high in the sky.  When it began to move, I pointed the object out to my friend, who also began watching it.  We both watched it move towards the west\/southwest in a straight trajectory for about 20 or seconds or so, at which point the object\u2019s brightness began to fade until it disappeared about 10 seconds later. Overall we watched it move for about 1 minute, until it seemed to disappear.  The light just slowly faded, and we did not see it appear again along its trajectory, like we would have expected if it had gone behind a cloud or something.  As far as I could tell, there were no clouds in the sky; the forecast for the evening was clear skies. At this point, I noted to my friend that I had never seen an object that bright in the sky behave this way.  We wondered if it had gone behind a cloud or a mist, but again, it was strange because it was dry and clear out.  The object was high enough in the sky to seem to us to be a planet or star at first, but when it started moving and then disappeared, I was baffled. At first we both thought it could have been a satellite, but the way it tracked across the sky wasn\u2019t like other man-made satellites we have seen before.  I didn\u2019t think it was a meteoroid, as it did not flash across the sky quickly, but moved slowly. Talking with my friend about it the next day, neither of us had any immediate explanation for it.  I\u2019m still curious as to what this object might have been. Thank you for maintaining this valuable resource for the public! ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a remnant from the SpaceX satellites??

Objects were synchronized in an eastern pointing line traveling due east (traveled from center sky and out of sight to the east in ca.20\u201d-40\u201d. At first the four objects were evenly spaced, however throughout sighting individual objects slowed and accelerated independently within line.  Objects appeared to be very high in atmosphere and to be traveling quickly - observably quicker than average satellite sighting (consensus of all present).  No sound was heard.  One observer (ex-military) hypothesized high flying military jets (interesting as it was Memorial Day weekend).  Those who observed objects were not convinced as to this explanation.  All agreed they had never seen anything similar before.","1311":"Starburst of gold light overhead appeared then 3-5 starbursts shot out in a completely straight line.

I looked away and back a few times, noting what I thought was a dark, rounded glove or sphere shape with the light curved along one edge, which is why initially thought it was the moon.

I have spent most of my working life in the outdoors in Forestry.  With four college degrees and being a published author, I\u2019m used to giving accurate, detailed descriptions.  Very analytical.  This is what I saw on June 7, 2019, a Friday.  There are military bases nearby, submarine traffic, shipping lanes, airports in this area.  I\u2019m used to seeing different types of military and civilian aircraft. I was standing on the back deck, with a beautiful, mostly sunny day.  Jet engine noise made me look into the sky, and something caught my eye, coming from the south, moving very fast!  By my calculations, it traveled from directly over my house, to East of Victoria, B.C., in two seconds!  Made a 90-degree turn and headed towards Whidby Island and military installations.  A small cloud obstructed my view of the turn, but there was no veering out to account for inertia in the turn.  That I saw!  There seemed to be a shimmer around what looked like, a wing shape, with no fuselage visible.  The wing shape was slanted back about 15 to 20 degrees, and a shimmer was around the wing, and a straight edge was visible at the end of the wing shape, on both sides.  No fuselage was observable.  The leading edge of the wing appeared dark.  Looked like a flying wing.  And jet engine noise. The estimated distance traveled in two seconds was fifty miles!!!  By my calculations\u202630,000 to 45,000 mph!!! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  However, we question his assumptions about distance and velocity.  Witness provides hand-drawn image of what the object looked like to him.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Addendum to flying wing shimmering and 90 degree turn at speed of:  2 seconds travelling 10 miles Good talking to you, Peter.   The following is my best recollection of what I saw.  10 miles is a reasonable distance for the object to have traveled in two seconds and would be traveling at 18,00mph!.  At 50 miles, that\u2019s still in U.S. territory and 2 seconds would be about 90,000mph.  The background was blue sky when I saw what looked like, a flying wing.  That's what it looked like.  A loud roar like that of a military jet passed over our house.  That's why my wife and I looked up, but I was the only one who saw this object.  Three-seconds and it was gone.  It came from the direction of the Olympic Mountains, (Mt Olympus is 7900ft.) so I think it was descending.  The small cumulus cloud I saw I estimate at 3000ft because 3300ft is the usual lowest altitude for Cumulus clouds, which the object passed through.  No way they were at 10,000ft. Using my clinometer, (I am a trained surveyor and forester, also a Navy veteran).  I calculated a 10-degree upward slope, at 45 degree azimuth, looking at the object. I immediately went inside the house to draw what I had seen. 10 miles out, towards Canada, is where I think it made a 90-degree turn, heading East.   This would coincidentally point it towards military bases in the area. At 10 miles, the calculated speed was 18,000 miles per hour!  (2 seconds and 10 miles away)  Also coincidence, close to escape velocity of 25,000mph.  Slowing down on landing approach?  It was in broad daylight and whatever it was, did not appear to be in trouble or care if anyone saw it. I\u2019m not an artist but this the shape of what I saw and the \u2018shimmer\u2019 around the flying object: a boomerang shape with a 15 degree back angle on the wings.  About double the size of the sun, using your thumb as a reference. Like you said Peter, I hope this is ours.

I was stepping out to get something out of my vehicle when I noticed first what seemed like a flash of light similar to a beam from a lighthouse from the corner of my eye. I looked up into that direction, which was northward, and then I didn't see anything. Moments later, I saw a light light up in the sky moving northward. After the light was on for maybe 3 seconds it went out. I assumed it was an airplane at first oh, but I didn't see the static red light. I know the fixed red light is on all airplanes, I worked in Navy aviation so that's normally the first thing that I would see on a plane that is flying at night. After another three or four seconds having not seen the light come back on, it did again but it only remained lit for maybe another half of a second. After the light disappeared the second time, I did not see it again. I have not ever seen an aircraft where the lights acted that way, so I felt very suspicious about it. There were no clouds in the! area where I was looking at, I was able to see all of the other stars around the light that I saw. And the light appeared to be larger than the Stars, and it was a very dull yellow almost white light.","1332":"Looked like heat lightning.  Stayed in sky like a light house.

I was admiring the  view, when a strange sphere caught my eye.  I was looking to the south as if it were above Duncan, BC.  It was angular (a faceted sphere), orangish-brown (sort of like rusted metal) and was reflecting the light emitted from the city along one of its flat parts.  It was rotating slowly as it smoothly glided across the sky, similar to how a satellite moves.  But it was HUGE.  It looked to be higher than an airplane's altitude, but large enough for me to clearly tell its colour and shape.  There were no lights coming from it aside from the reflection, and it was silent.  I alerted my boyfriend who was also bewildered by it and then we noticed a second one following behind at the same speed.  They were sort of smoothly gliding\/tumbling across the sky to a similar speed you'd watch an airplane fly across and eventually entered cloud cover.  The whole ordeal was about 1-2 minutes of uninterrupted  observation on our part.

Just after midnight (CST), I saw two lights in the sky roughly 45 degrees up and to the east traveling towards each other (on an east\/west track).  Once they came to a close proximity, the lights rotated in a full 360 degree maneuver to form vertical circle, equal distance apart, then traveled off in opposite directions (again on an east\/west track).   These were not regular aircraft lights as they were not flashing, red or green, they were a white lights.  We have large commercial jets flying over Regina on a daily basis, I have never seen that occur.  As this entire event took place in under 30 seconds. Sky was clear, other stars visible in the night sky.","1350":"Unusually bright star-like object low on horizon near city. Unusual bright \"star\" which I viewed out my window while seated on the couch.  Caught my attention because it was unusually bright, being near the horizon.  I looked at it out the window for several minutes, then went out onto my front stoop, where it very slowly moved out of sight.  It did not appear to be over my neighborhood, but rather, it seemed closer to SeaTac airport or perhaps over Fairwood\/Kent.  There was no noise.  It appeared to pulsate.","1351":"Red white and blue circle among stars in Kittitas Washington. We were sitting outside stargazing when we saw a strange looking object among the stars.  We noticed it began to flash red and blue as well as the white light. It is stationary and has not moved and it\u2019s too far and high to be a cell tower.  It has also grown in size throughout the duration of watching it.","1352":"3 bluish\/white spheres hovering, then one moving very fast seen by two people in Greene County, IL. I was taking photos of around my back yard of birds and looked up. suddenly,  There appeared three round objects in plain view in the sky, and I called for my father to come outside to see.  One due East of my location, moving very slowly, like it was floating in a westerly direction.  Another was doing the same to the Northeast.  A third, toward the Southeast was doing similar, but then after a few minutes, at a speed unthinkable to us, flew off to the south and vanished.  They made no sound.  Heavy clouds were moving in from the Northwest which first covered the one to the Northeast and we lost track of it at that point.  The one due East was visible long enough, before the clouds moved in, for me to take two photos and a brief video of it.","1353":"Cylindrical objects emanating from unusual cloud formation above cloud ceiling visible from plane Flying for the 2nd time in 1 week, I was drawn to a cloud formation that was not moving.  It was a large formation in an otherwise flat cloud bed.   I started taking pictures of it and noticed there were cylindrical objects on the pictures.  I eventually took video, but the quality is poor.   There were at least 5 objects that seem to have come from in or around the cloud formation.","1354":"Whole crossing the bridge noticed a really bright light in the sky towards the south.

I know we have an airport nearby but this is just like no track once I see it I can't find again in the clear skies.  But yesterday, at 18:30, I witnessed it want wanted to let you guys know.  It's like an airplane size oval shape light that disappears after a few seconds.  Sometimes I keep looking thinking there is a cloud it goes into because that's the sensation that it goes into something in the sky but it just disappears.  I've seen this incident a couple of times this month.   I also noticed this around  17:00  in the Central Florida Parkway maybe a few months ago zip code 32821 facing north same exact shape bright, light shows and in a few seconds disappears as if it was going to a cloud but there is none.  In a way looks like a bigger version to what you ! will experience if you are having a huge migraine the little dots of light you see flashing but bigger like airplanes and only one that goes away in a few seconds by disappearing in the sky. It has been only one single light each time I see it.  I am always observing when I can and I spend 1 to 2 hours driving for commuting so I am aware of my surroundings and look up as well.  No rainy days on daylight all these occasions.  The sun is always to the right when I'm driving from I-4 Close to Conroy Road towards Daytona area.","1356":"I work next to the airport and noticed a floating orb bouncing slowly around the airport.  Other planes were flying around it, but I could only see it with polarized sunglasses.   The sun was reflecting off of the metallic top of the craft.

They remained motionless as planes went underneath them.  They were about 1\/2 mile apart and must have been very large as using commercial jets underneath as a reference. The sighting lasted approximately 30 min.  We took pictures and small video, looking at the picture blown up, it appeared to be round and glowing as bright as the sun.

Did not change position during the 20 minute sighting and were eventually covered by incoming clouds.  At first sight we thought they were stars but were closer and larger than a true star.  The evening sun made them shine like stars, I do not believe they were emanating light.   This was approximately 5 miles E\/SE of Kansas City International airport.  There was nothing particularly significant about this other than they just didn't move at all the whole time while clouds and aircraft were crossing above.","1362":"Noticed one reflective dot in the sky, totally motionless for approximately twenty minutes.

Many different low brightness blinking UFOS, sometimes emitting pulses of spread light.  Movement was erratic, non-linear acceleration in many of them.  Could easily move from their current position to an entirely different position akin to shining a laser pointer and moving it across the sky, their velocity had no inertia insofar as I could tell.  There was more than a dozen of these sighted phenomena, and each of them moved in erratic manners.  Occasionally split off into more vehicles, though this type of event occurred less frequently.   Extremely dim light emission, unable to be received on Android A6 smartphone camera.","1368":"Shooting star (Meteor), and what looked like a red fireball, and made no sound.  I was sitting on the porch smoking a cigarette, when I noticed a shooting star; made a wish. Then through the trees a red light was flying kind of slow,  I thought it was a plane at first cause it looked like a red light blinking,but it wasn't.  It was a floating fireball moving through the sky.  I opened up the door and yelled to my mother to look at this UFO.

During the winter time, the same lights can be seen as well.  The lights seem to be intelligent and controlled!

This one was not an orb, I thought it was longer light. Vertically.  As I zoomed closer it appeared different.  I have been studying the images I took and zoomed in again, and am able to see a triangular shape.  You can see very clearly the form.  They were a few different things happening as we were looking at that direction.  We could spot more than one object.  I took a couple of videos hoping that at least one would capture the right image.  In the video that I play repeatedly, you can also clearly see how something shoots out of the bigger object.  The object appears and disappears.  When they appear again it was slightly a different area.  Not the same spot.  At some point, it moved above us.  Extremely high in the sky I would not even be able to calculate ! how far up it was.  I do know it was above us because that\u2019s where it stopped and then left.

They thought it was a plane at first but it was flying relatively low and they were were unable to make out a shape of the object which was strange because there were commercial and small engine airplanes flying this evening at varying altitudes and they could make out the shape of the planes even though it was dark.  This thing had about 5 rectangular white lights oriented vertically across the back of it.  The lights pulsated and flashed in a staggered order and then they would go completely dark for about one or two seconds and continue flashing again in rapid succession.  They were not able to hear any sound coming from it nor were they able to see any kind of exhaust trail coming from! it.  It moved from west to east in a straight line and they observed it facing south.  It moved slower than a single engine plane would which made it stand out even more.

It was going from West to East then stopped, went south for a short distance, did this zig zag in the sky and shot off rapidly towards the east until it disappeared.  Was out of this world for sure!

The lights were in a disk-like formation and several more appeared between some of the lights.  This honestly reminded me of the Phoenix Lights.  There is Fort Riley near by, so I'm unsure if it was a military thing, but these lights were so close and not anywhere near Manhattan or the military base.

The helicopter traveled normally out of my line of vision, but I noticed a bright white oval or circle very very very high in the sky (much higher than the helicopter had been; if an airplane had been at this altitude it would have looked tiny or almost indistinct). It was moving unlike anything from nature or a human made craft.  It moved slowly in an organic curving pattern, sort of meandering back and forth, toward the sun then away.  It almost looked like a paper plate blowing in the wind, however it seemed way too high to be an object from Earth and the distance it was traveling in each motion was fairly long \u2014 way too far for an object to be blown back and forth I think.  It would also pause and stay still for periods. I watched it for at least five minutes. There also appeared to be many swirling white dots around the sun, moving like those fireworks that snake around willy nilly after they launch.  It did not occur to me until later that day that I should not have been able to look at the sun in the way that I must have been to see the swirling lights, but the sun did not hurt my eyes until I tried to look back and take video. While I was taking the video it disappeared. The short clip shows the object floating in the sky. The longer clip shows, at the end, an object with two lights appearing and dropping straight down suddenly and disappearing.  I did not see this with my eyes because the sun was too bright, but it is clear around :07-08 in the lower left of the sky shown if you zoom in on that region.","1404":"Floating orbs in midday suddenly disappear. Walked out side to let the dog pee and noticed two floating orbs of light off in the distance just above my eye line of sight and fence line.

As I was turning onto my street I saw it and it was a metallic color and it was just hovering there, in the southern sky, which San Antonio, Tx, is south of where I was at, so I stopped my car and when I got out with my phone to get a video it started moving east and then started moving south and then as it took off to the South a plane flew over and that was at 8:40pm Central  Time.. and I have video","1406":"It doesn't look natural I'm the clouds The main one looked like ..a Clingon ship with a few more behind the main one.

I took a look, and noticed flashing lights so I said it was a plane.  I went back inside the laundromat and came back out about 25 minutes later, and my girlfriend pointed it out to me again, making a point of how erratic and quick its movements were.  I observed, and noticed the same.  It is moving too fast to be a conventional plane, and my girlfriend says that it\u2019s too high up to be helicopter.

I was looking north at a bright red light.  It was moving slowly (similar to the speed of a commercial airliner.  By the way, there were five commercial jets surrounding the Denver metro area at the time.   I happened to be watching the sky and counting the number of jets I could see at one time.   This particular 'jet' was moving toward me, but it struck me as odd that the light of an approaching jet was red.  They are always white.  Now, I realize that is sometimes difficult to ascertain whether an object is approaching or going away from you.  That's not my point.  The point is, the speed at which this object switched directions was 10x the speed.  It was then fast flashing white.  I then video captured more of these rapid switching movements.

My father and I couldn\u2019t identify the object, initially assuming it was a blimp, but it was far too high.  It remained stationary for the ten minutes we observed it.  My mother and neighbor also witnessed the object, but they weren\u2019t as intrigued.  I had to get my kids home to Kearney before their bedtime, so I drove away.

We spoke for about 10 minutes before he excitedly mentioned an object with a flaming tail moving toward the initial UFO.  He didn\u2019t mention any sort of strike, but the second \u201cflame-tail\u201d object continued moving east.   Within a minute, I could see this second object above Kearney, flying surprisingly low.  It was streaking a pair of vapor trails as it flew east.  It was flying low enough that my phone could flicked in and out of focus on it as I trying taking snapshots.  What my dad assumed was a flaming tail, I figured was the reflection of the sunset on the lower-rear hull, as the sun was setting.  As low as the plane was, the wingspan seemed too narrow to be a commercial airliner.  It was also flying far faster than I recall my flight from Denver to Omaha ever going, as it flew into Kearney airspace and left it in what felt like less than a minute. As a strange coincidence, several sirens started going off near my house at the same time.  I couldn\u2019t tell if they were police or ambulance sirens, but they faded before long.","1427":"Bright light in sky Our camera outside had a motion sensor and was set off by a light in the sky, which doesn't look like an airplane.

Circa 2 AM I started to hear seagulls squawking which is pretty unusual. Since they were keep making noise for a while I went to the balcony to see why the commotion. I live half a mile from the coast. Saw a reddish triangle hovering over the sea, quite big. Now in this location it is pretty common to have fishing boats and other kind of vessels, but it was nothing like that.  In fact, there were two different boats near it, like 50-100 metres to the right and left, I guess.  Unlike this vessels which have small distinct white lights, what I saw was like a huge mass of lava-like light, slowly fading into nothingness.

Unknown to any movement it only appeared as a star or a close planet. Usually Saturn or Jupiter is in the lower southern sky (object was about that same size and brightness), but it was late enough that they had moved west behind some trees. I wasn't familiar with such a bright light at that angle so as I got down on flat ground and stopped and observed..  the light was now gone.  I noticed some haze in the atmosphere, I'm sure that whatever it was I saw..  it was not being covered by clouds.  It was much more \"Dim\" and moving directly South. 5-10 seconds then I lost sight of it.  At that point, the object appeared to be just a satellite.

At approximately 3:30 a.m. EST while on work break in South Charlotte I heard a strange whooshing sound for about 5 minutes, I looked up and did not initially see anything.  The sound continued, but did not get louder nor distant, then I saw a single red blinking light followed by 3 very bright and vibrant white lights (brighter than those that come from Xenon gas bulbs) that flashed one at a time making a line pattern in a different direction than the red light, making it appear as if the object was changing course,  however,  when the red light would re-appear, it was at the front of the direction the object was moving, and the white lights were angled off to the side. .  If all those lights were to be illuminated at once, it would have made an \u201cL\u201d shape.  I see all types of commercial and military air craft here at night especially being in the flight pattern of the airport, I have also seen weather balloons, satellites (no blinking to their lights) and the international space station fly over.  None of which had the sound or light patterns I experienced tonight.  The strangest part of this experience was that when my eyes focused on those lights as it was directly above my head, the sound ceased.  Even as the object passed, and what you would usually hear from the rear of a craft as it passes by, there was complete silence as I watched it move overhead then eventually out of sight.  I have to add, I am a total skeptic and I have tried for hours to make logic of this experience, but the more I try, the more questions I have.  Most importantly, if it were a military type jet propulsion aircraft the sound is more like a constant distant thunder (even when it is very high in the sky) that gets louder as it gets closer, then the sound gradually fades.

It traveled in the clear night sky, in low earth orbit, at very high speeds with no audible sounds.  It was slightly slower than a meteorite\/shooting star and much much faster than a satellite.  It had no visible tail and kept on path heading from West to East and was only in my field of view for about 4 to 5 seconds.  At the time I was star gazing and looking up at the big dipper constellation.  Roughly 4 minutes later a passenger jet or possibly a private jet was on a similar path but moving quite slow.

I was on the balcony enjoying the light scattered rain while my friend slept. All of a sudden my phone froze and switched screens.  Then RAPIDLY flipped through a FEW screens. By the time I got the words, \"What the heck?\" out, I glanced up toward the sky, and seen a strange flat type disc hovering the Atlantic! (I am a 38 year old lady and I'm putting EVERYTHING I KNOW AND OWN that this was NOT a boat!)  I couldnt take my eyes off of it because I REALLY didnt want to believe it to be honest.  So I made my right hand go behind me and slide the door open and mumbled for my friend to please come to the door. (I wanted him to tell me that wasnt what I thought it was.  However, he did not.) It had yellow\/orange tinge lights going around it.  In uniform.  And just kind of hovered there.  Then it threw off two floater type lighting hover balls (?) that floated at the same level for a while.  Then a few strikes of lightening were REALLY bright and it was confirmed. that it was NOT ON THE WATER-!!  I WAS SO SCARED I actually started crying and I STILL WANT TO!  Of course I do have a few pics I was somehow able to get. Then after a bit...  It disappeared.  Just GONE.  About 2 minutes later came one HELL of a storm!!!  Flooding the parking lot of the hotel I'm at and all.  There happened to be a bit more that went on afterwards.  The coastguard (if I'm not mistaken) had come oit to that same area about 20-30 mins later (give or take). I'd really appreciate it if those who specialize in this area would mind confirming?

It was near the foot of a hillside that began to move in front of my view and the craft hiding it from my view in my truck.  This puzzled me as I thought why would there be such a bright stadium light on at this hour, so I turned around about a minute later to see what it was and at that time it was gone.

It was behind trees for about 2 flashes. The next flash it had moved quite a bit from left to right. The next flash it had gone back to the left but a different area of sky. The next two flashes is when my wife also noticed it and it moved from left to right with each flash but again had moved quite a bit of distance. The next flash it was back behind the trees all the way to the left close to where the 9 year old first noticed it. The next time it went off it was gone. The light did move while it was 'on' but was slow moving. When it went 'off' and turned back on it had moved extremely far compared to when the light was 'on'.

Took my dog out for his last night potty run about 10:45 pm tonight.  I always look up at the stars at night as it was something Dad and I used to do when I was growing up.  He was an engineer, designing early communication satellites, and I know quite a few of his designs are above us, circling the Earth.  Dad taught me how to identify a planet as opposed to a star, and how to track the satellites when they go overhead. Tonight, I caught a glimpse of a flash of white light out of the corner of my eye traveling from the west to the east\/southeast sky above the star Altair (used my Sky Guide app to figure its location), then dismissed it as I thought it was a light of an airplane high overhead.  We are under the flight lines for our local airport and the nearby military base.  I looked to the south and then back over where I saw the light and saw a smaller glimmer of it.  Continued watching that area of the sky and it flashed again and again, somewhat in a predictive sequence about 2-3 seconds in between each flash and the duration of the flash was a fraction of a second which made it very hard to predict where it was going.  When it flashed again, this time it was like a streamer flying in the wind with a 1-2 second duration and then it disappeared, only to quickly flash again a few more times before the light dimmed out of sight. I do not believe it is a UFO craft.  I believe I saw a satellite which may have been knocked so it's spinning while in orbit and caught the sun reflecting off its solar panels (the flashing light) instead of a steady glow which moves in an arc across the night sky.  The flashing light was still traveling as if it were following a satellite arc, that's how I could guess where to look when I realized it wasn't an airplane flying overhead.    Just wondered if anyone else had seen the same thing tonight.

Just.. sitting there.  It was high up as well as wisps of clouds seemed to obscure it.  After watching it for about 10 minutes someone asked me what I was looking at.

Other notes:  - It's central New Jersey; the direction I was facing was New York, the night was humid, there were light clouds close the source---in essence there was a ton of light pollution and visibility was mediocre.  Originally I thought the clouds moving were causing the pulsing behavior, but on further observation it was clear this was not the case.  Despite the light pollution I was able to see a couple of meteor-streaks.  - The sky was littered with planes lower on the horizon (Newark airport is extremely close), and---like any good summer night around 9pm---there were plenty of satellites (I saw ~20 over the course of an hour --- mostly east-west moving, some north-south(ish); some in the vicinity of the flash).  - Other than the \"jumping\" I described above, the source did not appear to move, even when flashing for long periods.  Granted, what I witnessed was close to the horizon so  that the apparent motion would be small, but I did not see any movement over the very long flashes, and satellites that passed through that vicinity were very visibly moving.  - Over the course of four years, I've seen two bright iridium flares in the same area on other nights---I'm pretty confident this was not that.","1513":"Long glowing rectangular craft with multiple balls of light appearing above it. I was walking out side of my work after closing at 3am and I noticed a long rectangular shape illuminating around the edges of it which lighted up the clouds surrounding it,  I took multiple photos and have several videos.

I looked up to the right of the fireworks going on and saw a huge circle\/sphere of a bright white light. It was way too large to be a star. Many others looked up and were amazed at what the object could be. It stayed visible about 30 seconds, then disappeared completely. It came back in same spot as if a light switch (on and off, and on). Then the grand finale began for the fireworks show, and the sphere\/circle of light disappeared then in the same spot three tiny green lights in the shape of a triangle appeared where the orb was. The three triangle light began to move bling on and off in a zig zag pattern away from the fireworks for about 3 minutes, then stayed in one spot blinking on and off about every 3 seconds in one spot as if watching\/analyzing the fireworks maybe? I went to watch the end of the show and then when I looked back the lights were there and disappeared. Never seen again. Could not have been a plane moving so fast in direct zig zag motions.

I looked up at the sky above me. I saw a triangular shapped craft flying overhead. It was about 20,000 feet in altitude. It had a flashing red light in the middle and two solid white lights at each point at the rear. The white lights created a reflection off the bottom of the craft. It was clearly a shinny black metallic surface. It was being escorted by two fighter jets. The jets had the standard FAA regulation lights. The jet to the left was at a higher altitude than the craft while the jet to the right was at the same altitude as the craft. They were flying due south. The craft was silent. The only noise came from the jets escorting it. I ran to the back door and shouted to my wife to come out. She came out and witnessed the craft as well. We took pictures but our cell phone did not capture anything other than the indistinguishable lights. We watched it as i! t flew beyond our field of vision toward the south. At arm's length, the craft was approximately 2 inches in length.  In comparison, the jets were about a quarter of an inch. Interesting night here in NC.","1528":"Massive Triangle in skies above Columbia, SC A massive triangle shaped object moved slowly across the night sky at what appeared to be 7500 feet in altitude.

My uncle was driving, my aunt was in the front passenger\u2019s seat, and I was in the rear passenger\u2019s seat.  The night was very dark, no bright moon, very few stars.   I was looking out the window facing west.  I first saw what looked like a white ball of light disintegrate or explode, followed by a tail or a trail.  I will describe it as a shooting star in reverse.  A few seconds later, I saw 4 large, white bright lights facing east; the lights were set close together at equal distances.  The object appeared to never move, and it was large and felt menacing.  There was also a dim glow coming from underneath the lights.  As I stared at the object, the two lights on the left turned toward the other 2 lights; so at this point, 2 lights remained facing east and the other 2 turned to face north, while remaining close together.  The 2 lights turned back to the east to align with the other 2 lights again.  The object never seemed to move, and I lost sight of it as we continued down the freeway.   At first, I thought it was a large 4x4 truck on a hill, but it was so dark I could not see the terrain, but the way the 2 lights turned make me doubt my truck theory. I tried to snap some photos, which I did, but they do not look like anything other than specks of light.  The true description of the object that I saw with my eyes is accurate as described above.  We were travelling at a high rate of speed and I did not use a flash.

I first saw what looked like a white ball of light explode followed by a tail of white light, then it was gone.   A few seconds later, I saw what looked like 4 large, bright white headlights set very close together. There was dim light coming from underneath the 4 bright lights.  The lights were facing east, facing the freeway.   I mentioned the lights to my aunt.  We were trying to determine what it could be.  The lights appeared to be stationary and continued facing us.  We then saw two of the bright lights turn north facing the other 2 lights but they remained very close together.  Then, the lights went back to facing the same eastern direction.

After arriving home and parking my car in the driveway, I looked up at the shot in the direction of the Burlington Bristol bridge, and saw a very bright red ball of light, stationary.  After about 10 seconds it started to move horizontally to the left, at which time I pointed it out to my friend with me.  We both watched it then completely change direction and move right in the complete opposite direction.  Silently.  It moved behind some trees and we lost it.  I called my father outside to see it, at which time it was not visible.  It then came back into sight, completely stationary, directly in front of us, in the direction of FDR middle school.  It had moved and covered some distance to arrive at this point.  So now, all three of us watch this bright red object double in brightness, as though the initial red light had a twin attached to it.  It then turned back down to normal brightness, as though there was only one red light again.   After it became less bright, it then moved left and right, straight up and back down, moving in ways that defy our technology today.  It then moved to the right, slowly, almost out of view behind the FDR gymnasium and the light began to fade as it moved.  Another second or two passed and the object disappeared from view and we didn\u2019t see it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I noticed off to the western sky, just above the treeline, there was a smallish red ball shaped object moving into my line of sight.  As it moved across the sky I expected to see it burn out quickly as you would expect a meteor to do.  However it did not.  It did not also leave a trail of any kind as I have seen from personal meteor sightings in the past. As the red ball continued across the sky, I listened for the tell tale sound of a high flying and fast moving aircraft but heard nothing.  To the north, Mother Nature was putting on a light show but there was no sound coming from that either. I looked for wing lights blinking, or any other sign of lights or such coming from the object but saw nothing, just a glowing red light surrounding the object just as an object entering the atmosphere would glow red.  As I stated earlier, I kept expecting it to burn out, but no. It continued across the sky until it went all of the way across my range of sight and disappeared into the eastern horizon. In all, this sighting lasted no more than 20 to 25 seconds at most, from horizon to horizon. Not a sound was heard. Nothing trailed out from behind.  No blinking lights of any kind. It stayed the same redish color from the second I saw it until it went out of sight. It appeared to be a rather large object as well because when you look at aircraft lights they appear to be tiny dots. This did not.  Comparatively speaking, it is like comparing a period at the end of one of these sentences to the eraser on the end of a pencil.  Big difference.  This was the eraser and aircraft lights the period. The most eerie thing was the lack of sound.  I hear aircraft at altitude fly overhead all of the time and expected something appearing so big to make some kind of sound.  Nothing.","1539":"Lights on Mount Helix A row of very bright lights was spotted on the east side of Mt. Helix, just after midnight.

The deck is at the back of my house facing west.  I was looking up at the stars (very clear night) in the northern sky, specifically the big dipper formation.  At that point a grouping stars caught my eye because I hadn\u2019t noticed them earlier.  I then realized they were moving in formation.  There were 3 bright white lights that were moving in a perfect horizontal line heading north east.  The formation in my estimation was anywhere from 300 feet to much grater depending on if they were actually satellite height or higher.  It was difficult to tell how far away they were but I would guess they were at passenger jet height.  There was at minimum a 100 foot gap, or again much greater, between each light and I was unable to hear sound.  As they were going by they moved slowly enough for me to shout at my wife several times to wake her up in the house on the couch sleeping.  She finally came out and! saw the lights a few seconds before they disappeared behind the neighborhood trees.  My wife said she saw them as red lights where I saw bright white lights.  We think the discrepancy was because she had just opened her eyes from sleeping.  They weren\u2019t flashing, they resembled slowly moving stars. We cannot explain this encounter to be anything less than incredible.  There is no question that my wife and I saw something we can\u2019t explain away or say that we saw anything that resembles a man made machine.","1554":"Bright flashes moving across the sky, in a Northwest direction.

At 01:45 hrs., I was feeding my horses, I was done with that and went beside my house, I was talking to my niece through her window and noticed a clicking sound coming from a outside automatic light that does not work, it sets almost to the apex of the house, so I was looking directly straight up.  When I did, I noticed a bright white flash, it was so bright that it was like someone flashed a flash bulb point blank in my face.  I tried to focus on that part of sky again looking in that general area and about 5 seconds later another blinding flash with a pulsing coming from the exact same light, as it was pulsing I got a pretty good view that it seemed to be cigar shaped and really super high. The pulsing stopped and then it was super hard to see because of how high it was but, I kept looking in that direction and noticed a commercial jetliner  going the same direction but I did not want to lose where I saw this object.  Then, again it flashed really bright, this time I had a little perspective as it started to pulse again and the jetliner that I saw earlier was approximately 4 miles away traveling the same direction as the object, the jet was way further than the object so the object was traveling super slow and much, much higher.  The object stopped pulsing and it was again very difficult to see. I tried to adjust my eyes to the speed that the object was travelling at and noticed it pulsing again, this time it did not flash but again travelling super slow.  Like half blimp speed if that makes any sense!  The object was moving west to east, I watched it pulsing then go dark, then pulsing, and going dark.   I watched this for approximately 8 more minutes, but I went in the house because I was having trouble seeing it anymore!  I have never seen anything like this before.  I know it wasn't any airplane, as airplanes have other colored lights that blink, this did not have any lights like that.  I know it was not a satellite because I have seen those and they shine and move fast and when they get out of the sun's light they slowly disappear.  A weather balloon while it could possibly move that slow, it could not have produced that bright white light that flashed and seriously blinded me for a couple of seconds and they do not have lights that pulse.  I was the only one who saw this, I do not have any photos or video of it, actually I was so astonished that it was like I was paralyzed trying to make sense of what I saw.","1557":"I had just finished working out and decided to walk down to the lifeguard tower #13.

My son and I were sitting on our back patio looking at the sky when we saw a disk shaped oblect come into view in the sky.  The object circled back and forth a few times and then completely dissapeared.  Immediately after disappearing, a black streak which looked like smoke from a damaged flying object appeared in the sky.  As the streak came down to earth, a military\/navy airship appeared coming in very high up and very fast towards the black streak that was coming towards earth.  This happened in the western sky last night.","1565":"Was lightning sitting on Lanai.  Saw what I thought was a star.

While beginning my exterior security rounds at 2:15am I noticed an unusually bright light in sky approaching very quickly in manner that was not typical of most planes & jets in sky. As it approached very near my direction at a very fast pace I noticed more details unusual about this object. I fumbled to get my cell phone for video but it was so fast I could only manage a quick photo after it passed me. The most unusual thing I noticed was how large & long the object appeared and that there was a haze in front of the light(s) that were at the tail end of the object. At first I only saw it as one light in sky. I thought for a moment it was coming right at me almost as if it saw me. Then in the sky about even with me slightly north (airport to south) it was not very high I noticed there were two lights in a vertical line one after the other and the distance between indicating a very long object, much longer then a typical jet. It clearly appeared as one object. I thought for a! moment perhaps a blimp. The haze was very distinctive and oddly visible in front of the lights. It had a translucent appearance almost as like an \"aura\" and was shaped like a cigar (or torpedo). It did not look at all like smoke or an exhaust trail and most odd was again the length of the haze forward of the two lights that were in very clear view behind the long shaped \"aura\" of the object that could not be seen. It appeared to be descending in the sky but in direction not typical of the other planes that land at nearby airport but further south of the sighted object. My photo does not show the haze only the two lights at tail end. Lastly there is a nearby airport to the south of this sighting. Minutes later a descending commercial jet in typical fashion even at night was very visible and distinctly heard as it descended for landing. The object I saw to the north was equally close enough to be heard and much larger & longer had me creeped out by the ee! ry silence.  I called local police shortly after returning from rounds to report sighting and find out if anyone else reported anything. It was clearly visible at all time to anyone who may have been out at 2:15am. No reports had been made by others at that time and I declined to leave name or contact.","1569":"Dog started barking eastward, I looked up and saw what looked like a satellite, or spacecraft breaking up upon re-entry.","1570":"Strange light in Pasco county FL Four people saw this object come across the sky horizontally with a long fire like tail.

Between 12:30 and 1:00 A.M. on July 3, 2019, I saw weird lightening-like lights high in the sky above the 30 acres of woods behind my house. My first thought was that it was some sort of freaky heat lightening.  I told my friend to check it out and he looked up but the sky was dark again.  When it happened a second time, I realized it was not heat lightening and had no idea what it was.  The sky was dark, then suddenly I saw several lights that formed a vertical rectangle\u2014but not a perfect one.   The lights were visible for a few seconds, during which time several pulses of electricity zapped from one side of the rectangle to the other sporadically and simultaneously.  Then the sky went dark.  My friend confirmed that it was definitely not lightening.  It happened again several seconds later, only this time it happened slightly lower in the sky and a little to the left of the first two pulses.  The next time it happened it was even lower and more to the left, but in an arc from the initial sighting.  We weren\u2019t sure what it was or what to do so we kept watching.  After several more appearances, it was 90 degrees from the initial sighting and just above the trees, then lower than the trees, then all we could see was a patch of pulsing light through the trees where it had landed.  Now terrified, we grabbed our belongings and I headed into the house as my friend drove out of my driveway.  I shut the lights and stayed away from the windows hoping I did not have any surprise visitors.  At 2:30 I went to bed.  I was too scared to go near the windows so I don\u2019t know if it was still there and\/or still is.","1577":"Fiery circular craft spotted hovering in Jersey City and then vanishes After watching the latest Spiderman movie with my family at Newport Center Mall in Jersey City we headed home.  After leaving the mall garage, we cut through the BJ\u2019s shopping center area and my wife (seated in the passenger seat) says, \u201cWhat is that in the sky?\u201d.  A few seconds after, my cousin seated behind my wife saw it too.  Since it was visible on the right side and I was driving I couldn\u2019t see it initially.  Then I opened the moonroof of my truck and I was finally able to see it.  Shortly after my son saw it as well. It looked like a large circular fireball hovering over a distant city somewhere west of us in NJ.  It was about as high as a plane would be flying.  The appearance of the ball seemed like a glowing orange fiery light and it seemed like it had some type of aura.  My wife\u2019s first thought was that it was a plane on fire.  But after watching the object for about 30 seconds that claim was quickly refuted.  I asked if someone could take out their phone to! record it.  My son immediately began to reach for his phone and as he started reaching for it to the second this bright orange object began to move North in a linear fashion.  As it started to move this bright orange light that lit up the night sky began to diminish in a matter of seconds until it was completely dim and vanished out of sight.  It\u2019s almost as though it knew we were about to record it.","1578":"Observed one object come across the sky right to left with what I thought were white trail from fireworks looked again noticed a red light at front followed by three white lights none blinking  then made a curve lost sight of object from my bedroom window few minutes later awoke by sound of the craft outside my window could see the object light on the bottom were white not blinking","1579":"MADAR Node 144","1580":"MADAR Node 140","1581":"Bright white circular object Bright white and pulsating circular object about 25,000 feet high above me.

Then I noticed the light was on one end of a fairly long object with a yellow light on the opposite end.  The shape looked like the edge of a silver iPhone, with a green light on one end and a yellow light on the other.   After observing it for 20 or so seconds, I noticed 3 more identical objects appear slightly below the first.  The group of objects appeared to be moving in a south-easterly direction, though at a very slow speed.  Over the course of a minute or 2 the lower 3 craft disappeared from my sight, but the one I initially spotted was visible for nearly 5 minutes.  It eventually became more and more difficult to pick out in the sky.  These objects were higher than any of the commercial airliners that few by the vicinity. There were other people there with me but were unable to see! what I was seeing. Background:  I'm a sailplane pilot and often look to the sky at soaring birds.  I've noticed that if you stare at a patch of sky for a while on a clear day you can find gaggles of birds soaring in the 3000-5000 foot range.  Also, I don't like flying with polarized sunglasses, but on this day I had a new pair that are polarized.  Sunglass can help you see definition in clouds and sky that you wouldn't otherwise notice.

It appeared overcast to the far east and far west with small scattered clouds to the south.  It was completely clear overhead and to the north with a 5 to 10 kilometer breeze from the north west. It was about 5 degrees Celsius. As I entered the park, I noticed the stars seemed particularly bright and beautiful this night. I was grateful for good walking paths as it allowed me to concentrate on the night sky.  I was walking due west along the southern edge of the park parallel to Crown Valley Rd.  I prefer this area because it is shaded by trees from the bright parking lot lights at the north east corner of the park. At approximately 12:18 a.m. (I checked the time on my cell phone approximately 2 minutes later.  It was 12:20) three lights appeared from behind the clouds to the west at approximately 15-20 degrees up from the horizon and slightly north of my position.  They were headed straight east and never deviated from this path.  They were perfectly in line and in sync with each other and were white or light blue in color with similar intensity to nearby stars or a brightly lit satellite. (not as bright as the ISS)  They were moving across the sky at a similar rate to a slow satellite. As it was approaching almost directly overhead I decided I should check the time and attempt to record the event by video recording it.  But, when I pressed record the camera light came on and I thought this likely wouldn't work.  Instead of taking the time to go into settings to switch off the light, I decided it likely wouldn't show anything anyway and I didn't want to miss anything.  I put the phone back in my pocket. When I gazed back up at the lights I was utterly shocked to see that the lights were not three individually flying crafts but rather one very large craft with the three lights in the center or belly of the craft. I could not see any detail other than the lights and the shape. From the front of the craft to the first light was as long or longer than the distance from the first to last light and the same distance from the last light to the end of the craft. In other words, it was at least three times as long as the distance from the first to the last of the three lights or longer. It was long and narrow and slightly wider in the center area by the lights. An elongated diamond shape. It was dark gray in color, only slightly lighter in color than the black sky around it. While it clearly covered the stars in the back ground, it unfortunately did not pass under any of the brightest stars which would have made it much more obvious. Incidentally, it passed directly through the pot section of the Big Dipper.  At it's highest point overhead, I would estimate to have been 75 - 80 degrees from the horizon. It was completely silent. As the craft passed by I fully extended my arm and was just barely able to cover all three lights with the second knuckle of my index finger (22mm. wide). It would have required 3 or 4 fingers to cover the entire craft. This thing was absolutely massive!  It is extremely difficult to accurately estimate it's altitude however by the way it entered and left my vision I am quite certain that it was at least as high as an ordinary passenger jet at cruising altitude (30,000 - 35,000 ft). Indeed, it may well have been much much higher. It was 12:23 when I lost sight of it. I immediately entered notes in my phone. The event lasted approximately 4 1\/2 - 5 minutes. The ISS passed by to the south west just minutes later. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites?

((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I am going to provide a map for a better idea on longitude and latitude below. We were on Farm Road 1000 coming around the first corner you will see veering off to the left on the map driving south towards the intersection of Farm Road 2280 in Washburn, Mo. I used the fire station as a reference point because it is probably less than a 1\/2 mile from where we first seen it at 9:33 pm, Sunday May 27th.  Farm Road 1000, or as locals know it, Fletcher ridge is a dirt road, so we were going pretty slow.  By our location we turned right, the map view on the link, you will see in opposite view, heading toward Farm road 2280. We noticed odd lights as we were at the corner to our left, we were fascinated because it didn't look like a plane, then we saw it was hovering and the lights were not normal.  Then it shot to the right of us, in the blink of an eye, a little beyond the fire station and starting hovering again.  That's when we got a better view of the lights.   There were white and green lights, way larger than a commercial jet and the belly of it had a LARGE red circular light with lights within it.  By this time we were at the intersection fascination went to fear.  So if there we other colors, I don't know, but I know it had white, green and a very large red underbelly and much larger than a commercial plane.  We took a left and got the heck out of there.  I don't think we have ever hit the main road so fast.  We live in Republic, MO, and close to SFG and see planes every night out on our patio.  We have never seen anything like this before.

But then I saw another, then three, then four lights in a row information, flying from east to west. The first one would flash, then the second, then the third, etc. I followed them with my eyes until they were out of sight.

I scanned our yard, the street all around, then I looked up toward the east and noticed this strange light in the sky.  At first I thought it was an odd airplane or something, but as I stood there, it became clear that this light did not come from an airplane.  It appeared as if a bar of lights in the sky ranging from yellow to burnt orange.  My best guess is that it was in the shape of a thick disk with lights around the outside.  I feel absolutely ridiculous thinking this let alone saying it, but it was if it was something out of a Star Wars movie.   The light began a strange dissent from the top of the tree downward on an angle, but appeared to be hovering as it moved left and right on its descent down.  After a short amount of time, I would guess around 60-75 seconds (I was so mesmerized that is my best guess as to the duration from start to finish), it seemed to just stop moving and simply hover in the sky and then it just disappeared. I don\u2019t know much about aircraft, but I have seen my fair share in the sky and this did not move like an airplane and the lights\/structure was completely different.

I was driving west on US Hwy 2 between the City of Ball Club and Bena MN. I was approaching a black vehicle and as I got closer it increased it's speed keeping pace with me. I was within 100 yards of the vehicle. It went into the oncoming lane of traffic and accelerated causing the rear of the vehicle to drop slightly. At that instant a VERY large cloud of white smoke filled the highway. I slowed my vehicle and turned toward the shoulder on the North side of the highway. As I went thru the cloud I expected to see the vehicle stopped or black marks on the road. Once I was in the Cloud I could see out, but it was still thick. I watched the ditch on the South side of the highway as well, but saw no evidence of the vehicle leaving the roadway. I expected to smell burnt rubber from the tires skidding or spinning on the highway, but there was no smell. As I came out of the Cloud I could see for a couple of miles as the highway was straight. There were vehicles ap! proaching from some distance to the front but no one going in my direction. I looked in my rear view mirror and there was another vehicle coming around the cloud on the north side also. I wanted to stop that vehicle to see what they saw and thought of the encounter, but I didn't feel comfortable with that of know how to get them to stop. All I can tell you about the vehicle is that it was a midsize black sedan. Nothing special at all about it. I couldn't rap my head around what I had just seen and for nearly an hour the hair on my arms stood straight on end. It was a very strange experience!!

It had not normal green and red softly pulsing light(s), thought was airplane at first but appeared hovering motionless and soundless for several mins... then very instantly and effortlessly fast traveled south-southwest and continued until disappeared in a cloud seemingly couple miles away!  It reappeared after several mins apparently making a big loop and back to its original spot where it\u2019s lights turned to pulsing white and red...  For about a minute. It then speed straight north-northeast?  Across sky and was gone... interestingly its flight course correlates to loc of beryllium plant down river and northeast is nuclear plant, very strange... wife thought it was a drone... but if it was it was, it would have been navigated over huge 5 plus mile area and was well out of visual sight range several times for several mins...? Not t! o mention battery life considerations and an altitude that would be very illegal for a drone... town People had to see it cause they were all out waiting for fireworks show to start by portage river. If it was a drone it was not civilian, and had incredible capabilities.  I worked on military a\/c and I don\u2019t know what it was?

The flash of whatever this was flitted across the night sky from west to northeast.  It went faster than anything I\u2019d ever seen before and flashed about five times.  The light of each rapidly progressing flash was pencil thin but very bright.","1615":"Entered quickly from East, decelerated rapidly. Fixed in place, displayed a number of light flashing patterns, red and green\/blue. Held red for last part of display, accelerated north rapidly and emitted white light while doing so. Acceleration\/deceleration was too rapid to be manned. We thought it might be a drone at first, but too fast even for that. No visible stabilization. When it was steady, it was rick solid. When it moved, it was rapid acceleration.weird, wouldn\u2019t be reporting this if we didn\u2019t think it was unusual.

Both men assumed it was a normal aircraft light coming towards us, light first, in the night sky.  When we realized it was flying upwards and towards the East, it flew behind a tree.  We ran across my yard to get better perspective.  When we found the object in the sky again, it had risen and appeared as a if it were riding along the Earth's outer atmosphere.  My perspective made it appear like a distorted circle of light with a dark dot in the center, that I assume was an aircraft or missile.  The event took less than 2 minutes and neither of us can determine what we really saw.","1617":"Low,slow flying over Morgan Maumelle exit. A single line of 4 bright orbs, with one out in front.

This slow moving object looked like a fireball moving slowly.  The size of it was like looking at an airplane or helicopter with lights flashing in the night sky except there were no lights flashing, just looked like something burning moving slowly like maybe fireball?

My son started screaming to give him my phone and pull over.  I did he jumped out and the three lightss split into separate pieces.  All going in different direction.  I started driving home and we kept our eye on the sky.  Pulled off on gravel to head home and a hundred yards off road was one of the objects hovering.  The whole thing pulsed light changing from white to blue to red once in awhile.  We where afraid to drive past it so turned car around and headed back towards town.  As we were driving the object took off and follows our path and stayed in sight to us.  We decided others had to see and turned back to make it home.when home, noticed several more.

Not sure what we saw.","1622":"Two shimmering objects in the morning sky hovering 100 feet apart very high up My bud and I were out smoking and he looked up in the sky and saw two shimmering objects in the sky above our building.  They were about 100 feet apart n hovering really high up.  They were too small to tell what shape they were.  They were moving across the sky very slowly keeping their distance the same between them.  It was in the morning as well.

My husband and I were driving on the New Jersey Turnpike that parallels Newark airport when we noticed what we thought might be a helicopter in the distance right near where the airplanes took off.  The airplane would\u2019ve been in the line of traffic from departing airplanes. I was in the passenger seat and was admiring the take off of an airplane that had the star of David on its tail.  I assumed it was and Israeli airplane.  As the airplane reach the air its Wing dipped kind of abruptly.  I thought that it would be a bit scary to be a passenger inside that cabin.  For a split second I say a dot in the airspace near the aircraft but immediately dismissed it as a bird or an optical illusion. As airplane evened out and seemed to turn around its course.  My husband asked me if there was a helicopter in the air nearby he asked me:  \u201cWas something happening over there?\u201d (pointing to the left side of the road in the nearby airspace.  He was wondering if there was some sort of activity happening. I looked behind him out the window and saw a shiny metal (silver) round object.  I thought perhaps it could be a drone and said \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it,  I think it might be a drone,\u201d but then on second thought and look it was not shaped like a drone.  It was more shaped like a slightly squished  sphere.  That\u2019s what my husband said he saw as well.  He said it looked more like a can in the sky but it was shiny metallic. I honestly thought maybe it was a drone but then I looked up what drones look like and this did not look anything like that.  There was no obvious wing or propeller of any sort. My biggest concern was having a drone, or an object like this, flying so close to the airplanes at the Newark airport.","1625":"Driving home though my neighborhood, bright clear sky and very little breeze, I noticed something flashing, it was even sparkling, flitting erratically.  I noticed it did indeed have a pattern, and it was turning clock wise, the craft was as high as a small private plane would be flying at. I kept my eyes on it after I have come to believe it was something extremely odd.  It then flew very high bu keeper the pattern flashing.  It was still very high and as bright as when I first seen it.  I parked and started to take a picture and another diamond craft flew across my screen and disappeared.  The 1st craft flew higher and disappeared. It had a diamond shine to it like a crystal it was really beautiful and I\u2019ve never sited a UFO before I have photos from high up but hard to ID.","1626":"During drops of chem trails, saucer appeared.

I looked to where he pointed and there was a large bright redish orange light with a smaller same shape colored object just a bit southwest of it in the sky.  I began to pull over because at first i thought maybe it was a planet such as mars. As i looked back at the object it moved in a northeast motion and was gone.

I was walking Mickler Beach that is located in Jackonville, Florida. I was there because I was waiting to see the launch of Falcon Heavy 9 from Cape Canaveral at 230 am.  While I was waiting for the launch to happen I was observing the stars, at the time there was no moon.  I saw a couple of shooting stars and satellites.  When out of the blue I saw this bright light coming from the northwest.    I was impressed so I pull my cellphone and started recording.  It was moving strangely, I concluded that it was no plane or helicopter, because it didn't make any noises and it was just a bright intermittent bright light. after two minutes it looks like it went southeast extremely fast or it went up (I couldn't see it after). I am sending this video to see what it was.  I didn't come to any conclusion. Thank you! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness on two occasions, and he seemed to us to be quite serious-minded.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thank you so much for the response.  Well like I said in the report I was at the beach. Exactly Mickler Beach. Its located in the city of jacksonville, florida. I was waiting for the rocket falcon heavy 9 launch at 230am on the 25th of June 2009. I don't know why my celluphone didnt picked any stars. It was a clear beautiful night. Moonless for a couple of hours. I was looking at the stars and stuff up there. When from the corner of my eye I sae a shooting star. When I looked the direction in disapeard.  I SAW this very bright light.  Then I took my camera and started filming it. It was doing some crazy moves. And the thing that caught my attention was that it didn't have any directional lighta requeird by the FAA on any fying aircraft. I can't tell what it was and like I said unfortunatly no stars where picked up on my celluphone SAMSUNG GALAXY S10E. It was doing some crazy manouvers and all of the sudden it was gone.  Took of like to the south east.  I was speech less. And all I have ia that video and unfortunatlly I was the only one at that beach.  Again thank you ao much for responding. I wish it had reference points. I saw a report like back in april 30 I thing andit looks like thiS guy saw something similar.

Sort of like a caterpillar made of lights, moving close together and all in a row across the sky. Every once in a while one of the lights would glow brighter. There also seemed to be a dark tail that followed the line and blacked out the stars behind it. It moved really slowly all the way across the sky. I saw it with my friend and another friend who was camping in the same town saw it as well.","1634":"Large string of lights traveling across sky Standing outside showing my son constellations, satellites and airplanes at about 10:30pm when an extremely large linear object with 8-9 white lights in a row appeared in the WSW sky.  Over the course of 30-45 seconds we watched it silently move across the night sky ENE. A second later a plane appeared just off the path of the unknown object, the plane dwarfed in size compared to the massive size of whatever it was we seen.  We ran in the house to tell my husband and he said the cat was just screaming like he was stuck.  He ran to help the cat but our cat was at the door screaming for us.

We both noticed a formation moving across the sky.  3 bigger lights with a smaller one before the final third one.  Looked like Orion's Belt moving across the sky at a decent speed.  It was headed Northeast, once it started to pass over the horizon, it appeared to break formation with the smaller one vanishing first. the middle one flew out and vanished, then first, then the last.

One was stationary at the 12 o\u2019clock position while the other was at the 9 o\u2019clock position but moving north.  The stationary object started to climb continuing in the 12 o\u2019clock position.  A tear dropped object, a bright golden white, with a tail seemingly much closer to me came flying by heading in the same direction of the 9 o\u2019clock object, super fast and seemingly much closer to me.","1638":"A low bright orb light that got brighter, closer and then went straight up into space and disappeared. On 5\/27\/2019 at 11:24 me and a friend were on my back deck in Sandown, NH.  The view on my deck is a full tree line from east to west.  It was a clear starry night with the North Star almost right in the middle of our view. A little west of due north just above the tree line appeared a really white bright star.  I said to my friend \u201cis that moving\u201d and within a few second we realized it was coming right at us from about 5 miles away.  I immediately thought to myself that it was a jet airliner considering the speed it was coming at us.  I thought it would be cool to get a video of a jet flying extremely low directly over my house if I could be fast enough.  So I ran to grab my camera from inside. I was inside for about 15 seconds and returned to see the bright light about 2 miles away. Oddly enough, it was completely silent no engine noise or nothing. Just as the light was about 2 miles away it all of a sudden changed course from roughly straight south to rising into outer space with no hesitation.   The light that emitted never blinked, stopped or strobed, it just got brighter as it got closer.  It traveled straight up for about 5 seconds when I said to my friend \u201cit\u2019s going to disappear\u201d.  Not a split second after that when I finished fumbling with my camera, the object did just that and faded out and was gone. I know this was not a commercial jet, satellite, balloon, drone, etc.  The size was big enough that I thought it was a jet.  It was brighter than any star right from the get go to only get brighter.  It was always the same white light and did not change color.

Looking in the direction of the Big Dipper, I saw a bright orange single light, about as bright as Jupiter or the brightest stars, just come into being out of nowhere.  There was no sound, no smoke trail, nothing to suggest this was an aircraft of known type.  This thing appeared to be really high, like tens of thousands of feet high, and really bright orange-red.  It moved slowly, much too slowly for a meteor, in kind of a wavy \"s-shaped\" pattern.  It made a soft curve and flew right through the bowl of the big dipper, then started to fade in intensity slowly over about 3 to 5 seconds until it was completely gone. People see these things all the time up here, operating at night in the wee hours of the morning in secluded places.  We call them \"movers\".  I personally see them at least once every two years.  They are always single star-like lights, very bright, moving in curved paths, moving silently with no wings or vapor trail.  I've been seeing them in these mountains since I was a teen age, and they are not satellites, I know what a satellite looks like.  These things are way too slow, follow curvy paths, and seem to come in from space and then go back out to space within half a minute or so.  I've seen them seem to notice when they are being observed, and I've seen them fly in to clouds for cover.  I sure would like to figure out what these things are, they are too dim to film with an iPhone camera.","1640":"Phoenix 1 am two sets of what appeared as red lights changed formation for several minutes; then one formation moved north and vanished.

My cat freaked out, and at that point, as I was looking up from my bed I saw a blue light linger in the sky through my translucent shades.  After about 30 seconds, I got up to see what it was.  I saw a large blue circle flash to white and move swiftly across the sky.

The sky was completely clear when suddenly odd looking clouds began to cover the entire sky.  Part of the sky looked as though an atomic bomb had gone off.  My wife and I were sitting in the backyard.   We live atop a large hill with views of Sedona to the left and old salt mines facing us.  We suddenly saw 1, than 3 than 6 total gleaming chevron shaped objects.  I am a former Navy pilot and have never seen a military aircraft or formation like this.  They kept grouping in a circle then rapidly gathered closely together only to spread out again repeatedly.  This lasted about an hour than they simply disappeared at the same time in a flash.

The just out of the sky, we hear this enormously loud trumpet blast, three times! (He said it sounded more like a trombone because of its timbre.)   On my piano, I found the notes were within a four-key (such as C,E,E and F - a major key signature) and were slurred (no break in-between the four-note phrase).  Each blast lasted about a second.  So loud!  We both agreed we had never heard anything like this and have no idea what could've been its source except to say that it came from the sky!  We discussed all of the options we could think of and came up with nothing that we're aware of that could emit these blasts. We are both retired Federal employees.  I am a former Public Affairs Officer for the USFS.

I don't think I was very accurate in my description of where we were because I was still stirred up over that noise!  If you travel Highway 2 east of Reardon, Coulee Hite Road is a left hand turn off Highway 2.  We were sitting in our little pop up camper which we have set up on our ranch property right now; it's so nice to enjoy our coffee there because it's cool (in the morning and evening) with the breezes.  I will ask our neighbors if they have heard any noises. We heard another one last night, but just a single loud blast; however, it was different from the three blasts we heard the other evening.

The object could have been oval or circular with an air stream behind it but I am not sure. I pointed to it and said \"what is that?\" a person next to me said \"I saw it too\" it looked like a falling star but it wasn't going downward, just straight across the sky. After it passed for about 5 seconds it disappeared","1665":"Multiple lights spotted North East of Dammeron Valley. Laying in bed, unable to sleep.  Looking out window towards the North East (just to the east of pine valley).  Noticed, what I believed to be star (amber\/orange in color), seemed to blink often and fade in luminosity.  Focused on it, (kept track of it between blinks). Eyes are open, notice that it seems to be moving to the west.  Prop head up\/readjust, \u201cstar\u201d drops towards the earth rapidly, and then ascends to its original position. Get out of bed, walk towards window, notice three lights - \u201cstar\u201d i originally saw was brightest.  Three lights seem to be hovering, only occasionally move back and forth.  Eyes adjust, notice smaller lights making rapid movements across great distance around larger lights. Wake girlfriend up, ask her to verify what I\u2019m seeing.  She notices first light, but from her perspective she\u2019s able to see 3 additional lights that were obstructed from my POV behind a tree.  They are positioned true east from my position.  These lights are darting rapidly along the ridge of Pine Mountain (back and forth). After about 20 minutes all lights fade (approximately 2:15AM).  Noticed strange static triangular formation (6 stars) shortly afterwards (NNW), but was unable to determine whether or not this was a star formation that went unnoticed during the initial event. Commercial airliner passed in the vicinity just after I awoke girlfriend, heading to the south.  Appeared to be in foreground, but was too difficult to tell. Given the dead zone in the center of my eye, looking just slightly away from the brighter lights seemed to reveal a bluish light around objects.  Sometimes things appeared to \u201cfly-off\u201d or away from them.  These \u201cfly off\u201d objects sometimes spiraled around other lights.","1666":"2 bright objects disappeared then heard rumbling east sky Getting out my truck 2 lights caught my eye in the east sky, it was if they were drifting but they were very far away.  They were bright like a slow moving fire ball I guess.  One disappeared then seconds later the another One disappeared.  One other time 3 years ago I seen what I thought was fire balls, it was 5 perfect looking round shape rocks in formation with each other like traveling across the sky in together in with a sphere together, literally over my head.  Come out of no where. The 2 objects I seen tonight were far away but had the same color as the group of boulders, bright white and yellow and slightly orange and maybe a little red. And after they disappeared I heard rumbling like thunder in a distance the lasted several minutes.","1667":"Orange probe like lights My friends and I were getting in the car to go grab some midnight drinks.  I happened to look in the sky and seen four orange lights.  I was so in awe of what I saw, that all I could say was \"whaaat on earth do you guys see that?!?\" We couldn't quite understand what on earth it could be.  They appeared to be orange circle probes. 3 were aligned together not moving.  The fourth one broke away from the three and looked almost like a fire ball with an orange auro around it then disappeared.  The three stayed for another two minutes then disappeared!!  As we drove and spoke about it, two more appeared but were falling down almost like meteorites.  Had we not seen the previous ones that were stationary, we would've just thought they were meteorites or debri burning through the atmosphere!","1668":"Star-like object making small erratic movements... up, right, down, rotating in circles.  Gets brighter and dimmer irregularly.  Looks exactly like a star would in the night sky.","1669":"Triangle formation of orbs or spheres over Savannah I had just moved my yard chair around to the side of the garage in back of the house to get out of the sun.It was nice and  shady there and I was looking up at a big sweet gum tree that needs a couple of big limbs removed that hang over the house.  I noticed a jet traveling north at a high altitude with no vapor trail and wondered why there was no vapor trail because it was cloudless bluebird sky.  Right then I noticed three round pearly white orbs or spheres traveling due south and they appeared to be much lower in the sky.  They were in a triangle formation and were moving a bit in the formation but maintaining the triangle.  They were probably at 11:00 position in the sky.  They were moving across the sky at what appeared to me at the same speed as the jet traveling in the other direction.  I thought to run grab the binoculars, but wouldn\u2019t have had time.  They were about to go behind the tree and the front one became two (2) right before it went out of sight behind the sweet gum.  I jumped up and ran inside through the the house and out the front to try and see them further but did find them with all the trees around.  There was no sound from them.  End.","1670":"Flash of light that jumped to another spot in the sky.","1671":"Very near Idaho\/Nevada border, I picked up a strange radio station and spotted at least one UFO - I didn't believe until last night. At approximately 23:47 on U.S. Hwy 93, 3 miles south of Hollister, ID the station I was listening to \u201cBoise State Public Radio\u201d on 91.7 when the usual news\/classical format changed.  It began playing very strange atmospheric, almost psychedelic music, with what sounded like whales in the sounds as well.  The noises in the music all put together sounded like something I had never heard before, it is almost impossible to describe the sense it created.  I continued for several miles, still tuned in for curiosities\u2019 sake.  At this point I was only a few miles south of Rogerson (8 miles from where I originally began hearing the strange music)  My dog that I travel with began barking very loudly, which he never does on car rides.  I very briefly looked back to calm him down when suddenly the music got much louder and when I shot my view back forward there was a very bright purple\/blue light just above the road, I swear it grew brighter and brighter with every passing moment.  It almost appeared like an air traffic light burning very bright in the middle of the highway.  I braked almost immediately and pulled to the side of the road, terrified as my dog continued to bark, yelp, and howl.  As I reached in my glove box for my pistol, the music went down to its usual volume and as I hopped out the large light was gone.  I could almost see nothing since the light took away my adjusted night vision.  I took out a cigarette to calm my nerves as my eyes readjusted, continued listening to the strange music still playing through my Oldsmobile and realized my perception of time during this whole incident was very skewed, a 15 minutes had felt like hours.  Just then I noticed five lights, getting brighter and brighter just as the first had, they were staggered almost like a Z with an extra line going straight up and slightly to the north from the south as I was facing it.  They stayed bright for several moments before one by one faded into the atmosp! here.  At some point during my dumbfounded staring at the sky m! y radio had gone to static.  After looking it up, I had been out of range of the radio signal since Hollister. I did not believe in UFOs or Extra Terrestrials until last night, if you had told me they were anything other than folk stories, I would have laughed at you. I have never been more wrong, or terrified of my mistake, in all my years.","1672":"Red Lights appeared and darted away late at night in NJ Pine Barrens My fianc\u00e9 and I were in bed, after 1AM on Tuesday night.  One of our dogs kept growling, but we heard nothing.  He finally got up to check it out and look out of our front window. He was out there longer than expected, so I finally asked him what he was doing.  He said \u201cthere\u2019s a weird, red helicopter thing outside\u2026\u201d so I hopped out of bed to take a look.  I looked out and saw nothing, thinking it was just his imagination, but then I saw it too!  Behind the trees appeared 2 visible, very bright red lights.  They moved upwards and then quickly down and to the right towards the high power lines across the street.  He described what he saw as 2-3 bright red lights that appeared seemingly out of nowhere.  They hovered and darted over, then disappeared before I came out and saw them.  I am in HR and he is in Law Enforcement.","1673":"saw what looked almost like a rocket, very high elevation, shoot across the sky in 3 bursts of speed and color from rear of whatever it way... it went from the west side of town toward the east, saw it from Wyoming and San Antonio area- 3 or 4 bursts of green and yellow, and incredible speed.   it was not a rocket, or an airplane or a meteor, for sure.  disappeared behind a cloud and gone--it was very fast, very noticeable and completely unlike anything I have ever seen, and I grew up on Air Force bases, so I know what missiles and weird planes look like.  I was watering outside and happened to be looking up and caught it.  I have seen other sightings, many of unexplained lights near the Sandia mountains, but nothing like this, ever","1674":"Light meandering West to Easy in North Florida. Standing outside in my front yard this evening, on the phone, I noted several drones or what appear to be  similar surveillance tasked aircraft when suddenly from the West moving due east - a light that behaved (aside from the obvious slow but visible movement East) as a planet would, devoid of twinkling, and having about the apparent magnitude of the planet Saturn would on a good night for observation via telescope. This light meandered very oddly modulating its North - South position on its trajectory constantly and in conjunction with its Eastward momentum.  Strangely the apparent magnitude of the light became increasingly dim as it progressed further to the East, eventually requiring some deal of focus to locate and identify during its remaining trek slowly travelling with the equivalent of a multiple drug influenced, severely drunken man's synergism fueled wobbly gait over the horizon.","1675":"Bright moving object in the sky in American Falls, Idaho What do y'all think this is?  Saw a bright light on the sky coming and disappearing while I was in the back porch of my apartment and decided to take my phone out to record it.  Keep in mind, I'm not moving my phone at all, my phone is still that thing is the one that kept moving all fast crazy.  It ended up disappearing into the sky.","1676":"Circular shaped object spotted off the coast of Edisto beach.  Object glowed and tracked at a steady pace.","1677":"Light brighter and closer than the stars filmed moving behind the trees for five minutes with no aircraft blinking lights. Driving from Canyon Village to Norris Junction, Yellowstone National Park, I saw a bright light, brighter than the stars, moving steadily low on the horizon.  No flashing lights.  Larger diameter than a star.  Did not fade like a satellite.  Had time to try three cameras, filmed it with my most low light camera so you can just see the shadows of trees it is passing behind, as it blinks, obscured by successive trees.  Sometimes you can see stars for comparison.  This isn't the first time I've seen something like this around here.  It's the first time I've filmed it.  Sorry for the blob of text, I just filmed it.  Also seemed like a more random path than a satellite.  I filmed a grizzly wslking the road 15 minutes before, in the dark, 10 miles away.  During filming yhe UFO, Which seemed closer than a satellite, I smelled a strong, musky odor, possibly elk.  Still, it was a bit much with all that's happened, so if you find fault with the report, remember I just! filmed a full adult grizzly tens of yards from my vehicle unexpectedly (I stayed in my vehicle to film the bear), filmed the UFO from outside my vehicle, bright circle, larger than a star, closer.  Closer than most other phenomenon I've seen like this.  I've not had a close encounter, closer than this anyway.  White to yellow white.  Brighter than Venus, which is unusually bright due to altitude here anyway.  Please excuse any typos.  I'm used to reporting bollides, I drive a lot at night and have seen many more than most.  This was not a bollide.  I also drive very long distances at night, that's why I've seen so many.  It's dark, clear, no moon, but I would guess I was in the vicinity of the wolf Lake pullout.  I'm not ruling out unknown Earth craft.  No sound, slthough I didn't turn off the radio during filming.  Since I write z lot I can compose this quickly, though it's blob form, normally I write longhand.  It might not have bern as straight a line as a satellite, an! d didn't change in brightness like a reflecting satellitr.  Si! nce I wa s filming, I couldn't tell if it turned slightly, and it was obscured by treetops sometimes.  It wasn't accelerating, however at thst distance, it was probably fast.  When I smelled the strong odor, I walked closer to my car immediately, just in case.  Stronger than most animal odors in the woods, even those I attribute, rightly or wrongly to elk.  Strong musky odor. This is the first one that's stayed in view long enough to film.  Normally see them just after twilight.  This video camera isn't a night video csmera, so it was at the limit of it's capabilities to film the light and faint tree shadows.  Most coulfn't with this setup, I know how, even then, sometimes the camera won't allow these settings for some reason.  Tonight it did.  Usually I submit bollide reports immediately, so I'm sending this right away.  It was moving East along the northern treeline, I'm tired, best I can figure.  With time, as it passed, I figured out how to film it better.  Seen these before, not! this bright, best I've seen, not blinding light by any mesns, brighter than a plane that distsnce, and no flashing lights.  Like moon, though just larger than Venus, etc, and moving much faster.","1678":"On my way home from work on a clear night In the end of March.  The road I travel is straight , s curve, then straight again for about 8 miles before another s curve then straight four about for miles to town.  I had just went around the first s curve and was getting into the straight part of the road, when I noticed tail lights in front of me.  Thinking nothing of it I watch as they went around the s curve about seven miles ahead of me.  As soon as the tail lights were out of sight two bright lights \u201c clicked\u201d on in the sky about where the turn was.  I remember thinking that\u2019s weird I don\u2019t remember seeing a plane.  It was odd enough I kept an eye on it as I was driving.  After about a mile or so I thought \u2018 why isn\u2019t it blinking like a plane\u2019?  My next thought was maybe it was a helicopter with spot lights.  After about four- five miles of watching this thing I began to get creeped out because it wasn\u2019t moving.  At about two miles I realized I wasn\u2019t looking at a helicopter, but a U.F.O. . The object looked like a pair of glasses in the way that it was two orbs connected and overlapped by a bar of light.  The whole thing I could see was uniform in color.  The tips of the wings were about to the far sides of the ditches with orbs being roughly the size of the lanes on the roads.  If I had to guess how think it was I would say  12-15 feet across the orbs.  The object was about 300-400 hundred feet above the road.  At this point I was freaking out and grabbed a weapon (unsure what effect it might have had) from my back seat.  Now less then a mile away and having to drive under It not though it, it started to pulse a very light pink color just on the iner sides of the orbs.  Now I was about to go under i looked up a saw no real \u201cparts\u201d just a black void behind the white orbs and bar. I was able the see it had a triangle shape to it. A couple of observations I made were that it didn\u2019t reflect light off the ground or my truck and it didn\u2019t seem to make any noise as I was gong under it.  Now under it I opened my sunroof and the object was gone!  After that I went home had a beer n went to bed. The next morning I woke up feeling a bit sick so drove into work early.  On my way to work I received a text from my wife.  This is extra weird.  She was apologizing for the rough sleep due to her dreams.  No kidding.  Her message was along the lines of \u201c I was dreaming we were in a camper driving and aliens were fighting in the sky around us!  I had to pull over and read the message again.  Now not wanting to put any ideas in her head about what I saw I told her I seen something weird last night.  At work I made it a half hour and was sicker the shit so had to leave.  Once my wife came home from work I asked her to describe what she saw in her dream.  What she described was two triangle shaped crafts the had dislodged their orbs to fight each other.

Around 2:00am there were thousand or more firefly lights all over the sky.  I looked out the window and a dim light was shining down on my home.

I was in my backyard around 9:45 a.m. on May 29, 2019, when I noticed something odd flying in the sky.  It appeared very white against the bright blue morning sky.  The object was flying from West to East.  Just to my west is the Front Range Rocky Mountains and Mt. Cheyenne. It did not emit noise that I could hear.  It flew in a very straight line. The object had zero lights.  No wings or tail. It did not waiver up or down.  It did not tilt side to side.  Just flew in what appeared to be a straight line. Wanting to catch it on film, I ran inside my home and grabbed my iPhone.  I was able to record the object on video.  The video is terrible (of course ) as I couldn\u2019t see it (the object) in the sky through my screen so I moved the camera around a lot but the camera was able to record it. When it flew behind (in?)(through?) a white cloud it was still visible although the top of the object appeared to become more white and domed-shaped with the bottom becoming rounder in appearance and darker. On video, when it comes out of the cloud it then looks to be 3 spheres in a close triangle formation. The video when slowed down and zoomed or viewed frame by frame is the best way to see it, but after a hundred times once you know what you\u2019re looking it\u2019s clear as day.","1684":"My husband were driving on 294 near O\u2019hare Airport in Chicago, Illinois, on our way to St.  Louis.

I was walking my dog when I saw a turquoise star about the current size of Jupiter in the night sky.  It was stationary and appeared out of nowhere.  I watched it for about a minute but saw no other lights on the object.  It appeared to be stationary in the sky.  The color was extremely unusual along with the fact that there were no other lights on the sphere.   I watched it for awhile wondering if it was possibly a drone but it was too high in the sky and too still and had no other lights on it and as I considered this it disappeared before my eyes.  It just dissolved.  This seemed to confirm it was either an object that was instantly covered by clouds or it turned on a cloaking feature or had some strange technology that enabled it to perform this strange feat.   Later, as I got closer to my home and approached my house, my spouse came out and I saw the turquoise star-like sphere object reappear over the neighbors roof line.  It then disappeared again after a few seconds.","1686":"Triangle shaped objects seen flying in Northern California. About an hour ago, as I was taking my dog outside, I noticed a white triangle blinking light in the sky.  After a few minutes, there were two and then three white triangles.  Then the speed of the blinking lights changed.  It appeared that the shape of the blinking lights had changed to the shape of a small person.  Then the lights changed to red and green.  It appeared the object was flying around a small area and then it suddenly went up.  It was flying around in a bizarre pattern. I stood there for a few minutes watching it fly around. I was frozen.  Then the object started to come closer to me.  I got spooked.  So I grabbed my dog and ran inside the house.  I immediately told my mom what I saw.  She then came out to see for herself.  I then went back inside to grab my phone so I could record what I was seeing.  When I came back outside, I saw that there was another object with red and green triangle blinking lights.  The second object appeared to be flying faster than the first one.","1687":"Triangular aircraft seen on Penna Turnpike From a distance, I saw a light hovering in the air from a few miles away, I had assumed it was an passenger jet flying parallel with the turnpike since it didn\u2019t look like it was moving.   It was foggy too so my other thought was that it was probably a communications tower.   After I got closer I realized there was no structure below it so it had to be an aircraft.  In between mile marker 318 and 317 I drove right under it while it just hovered over the turnpike.  I slowed down to about 50mph and tried to get a good look without endangering myself to other motorist.  It was a triangle, with blinking red lights on the wings and a few in the center with some additional white lights on the body.  It was probably no more than 300 feet off the ground.  It looked to be about 30-40ft wing to wing and about 40 ft in length.

What really made me report it though was the distance it was covering.  Like 15ish miles a second and when I did some calculations that would be close to 60000 mph.  Which is ungodly fast, there also seemed to be some intelligent maneuvering going on which makes me believe it wasn\u2019t a rocket.  (It continually changed direction) although I\u2019m no expert in weapon systems.

As I was listening to a friend talk to a group of four of us, I saw a light as bright as the full moon but smaller in size, which was about 1\/8 the size of the moon, travel in a perfectly straight line horizontally across the sky and disappeared into absolutely nothing.  There were no clouds and the moon was full and bright.  The light traveled faster than any airplane and was not a shooting star.  There was no tail or lagging light behind the object.  The size of the object was so large it could never be misinterpreted as an aircraft.  The manner at which it disappeared into thin air was a complete mystery.  I have never seen anything similar to this, and matter of fact have never seen anything other than aircraft and an occasional shooting star a handful of times.  As I yelled \u201cDid you guys see that?\u201d I actually startled everyone because they actually did not see what I had because it was behind them.

I was driving and couldn\u2019t really tell, but to me it looked like it had no markings and it could have been a black helicopter.  There is a military base 10 min away from the park and industrial area.  I was driving and could not stop so I can't confirm it was a black helicopter.  I don\u2019t think it a coincidence that I see a UFO and there\u2019s a helicopter flying around the vicinity after.   I\u2019m frustrated as the UFO only shows up o! n video the last 2 sec, when I clearly and visually saw it the whole time while recording.","1700":"Slender vertical craft seen disappearing behind a cloud A long slender shaped rectangle craft was seen in a vertical fashion moving across the ski very slowly.

I saw a green flashing light moving in a northerly direction at a very quick speed.  I thought to myself that thing is moving pretty fast.

After it\u2019s maneuver it went stationary for about 20sec.  After about 10 sec it started flashing a bright red.  I did not want to lose sight of it however I wanted to grab someone to validate what I saw.  I was gone for 5 seconds and when I returned it was gone.  This is something I have never witnessed before.","1702":"Oval bright white object there and gone in a few seconds Looking up in the northeast sky, I observed a bright white large object.

Then instantly disappeared","1707":"Bright Red\/Orange Sphere My husband and I were on our way home, coming up a hill from 980 Road (McDonald PA towards Cecil PA) when at the top of the hill we both saw a very bright red (almost had orange to it also) sphere. For a very split second we both thought firework because it the 4th and all but then quickly realized it didn\u2019t have a smoke tail, no immediate implosion or noises made like it could have been a firework- it was absolutely silent where we were at this moment because we had the radio off and windows down. The best way to explain or reference how high this sphere was in the sky, was that it was just above the distant tree line (10 or less miles out I\u2019d say) but close enough to looked pretty large and to be able to see the sphere shape to it from the bright glow. We both realized we have never ever seen a tower where this sphere was and it was definitely bigger than a blinking red tower light in the semi short distance it was from us and this was entirely way too bri! ght to not have noticed something that obvious the hundreds of times we\u2019ve driven this route home. The sphere\u2019s motion was pretty stagnant, did not obviously flash- it had veils of transparency from its glow but nothing could be seen indefinitely from where we were, solid but a beautiful bright inbetween tones of red & orange glow in color. We passed through some dense tree area trying to figure out what we just saw & my husband saw it through the trees but it looked further away and smaller in size. We attempted to turn at the bottom of the hill (Rt. 50) to try and follow it but half way down the road we hadn\u2019t caught any sight of it and thought it would have disappeared by the time we could get to a good clearing. Neither of us have ever seen something that beautifully bright before. We tried to think of everything possible that it could have been and rationally there is nothing to justify it. The video of the woman in SC or NC who recorded the red sphere in the sky (Dece! mber of 2018, I believe)  is exactly what we saw and she liter! ally exp lained and described the same exact thing we saw to an identical tee. Even the same questions talking through the what it could have beens. The only difference is that it was much closer to us then where it was to her, in her video. However the imagine on her video did not give any justice to what you saw with the naked eye.","1708":"While observing the city fireworks display noticed a bright green light high above fireworks staying lit, than would go off and continue in and out of a green strobe to a solid green than disappear, it proceeded to move about with various patterns of light to completely disappear.

Dusk, almost dark, about an hour after sunset I was looking up in the vicinity of Spica as I often do at this time of night to see if any satellites are going over...  I saw a bright flash of light and at first I thought it must be a satellite rotating thus making a flash by reflection of the sun but there was no repletion of the flash of light.   Then a sphere at a much closer altitude maybe 500 feet passed quickly East to West right over my head (it was not a bird!)  It was gray and travelled quickly in a straight line East to West out of sight in 5 seconds.  There was no sound whatsoever. It might be an advanced drone of some kind.  The odd thing is the bright light flashing before I saw it like seeing Spica but the it wasn't Spica which was further to my left in the sky.

This sighting is from the leeward coast on a clear beautiful evening where stars are easily seen and I am familiar with the night sky, know constellations, stars, planet locations ,etc. use astronomical telescopes, frequently see satellites passing over and local commercial and military aircraft are common here on Oahu.  I was looking North East in the direction of Ursa Major handle pointing to Spica in Auriga when I saw a satellite passing Northeast.  It or something else nearby winked a bright light and went out, just one flash.  This was at satellite distance.  I did not see the satellite again.  Seconds after a gray 5-10 foot sphere much closer maybe 500 feet above moved right over my property towards ocean West in direction of Kauai over the ocean.  It was absolutely silent and was not a normal drone with wings, propellers.  It was not hovering but moving in a straight line and in 2-3 seconds was gone.  Its path was geometric and resolute as if moving on line of force not being driven by an airfoil. Unusual.  Most military operations and civilian aircraft are offshore and helicopters that pass overhead are noisy of course.  This object was not a bird like a frigate which soar over the area sometimes.  Satellites as they move overhead often change their light because they are rotating in the light of the sun.  I have many times seen them wink a bright light, whether this is due to the sun or is intentional light semaphore being used is equivocal.  The sphere may have been coincidental and was an unusual \"drone\".  Worth reporting to your database .","1720":"Triangle shaped, 3 lights flashing red from a distance, looked like a bright star in the sky I was walking home from dinner with sister my 9 year old daughter.  We live one block from the beach in Fort Lauderdale.  There are multiple ways to go home but it was such a beautiful night we decided to walk along the beach last night.  My daughter saw a VERY BRIGHT STAR (as we were walking north towards our home).  My sister jokes that it\u2019s not a star but a planet. We saw another similar looking star not far away start to move -?we assumed it was a plane because we are about 20 minutes from the airport. However the airport is South of us & remember we are headed north.  No big deal at the moment... then the bright star began to move we thought it was our imagination so kept walking home.  My sister has a headache so we rushed back to our condo because friends were coming to meet us by the beach.  As I was coming out of my bathroom my sister screamed that as our friends were walking along the beach to us (2 miles south) they captured glowing flying objects in the! sky - our friend happens to believe in aliens & UFOs.  All of us do, however we didn\u2019t assume that\u2019s what they were at first.  We went back to the beach out of curiosity. All 3 of us climbed into a life guard stand facing the ocean to get a better look - sure enough we saw the flying glowing wings objects overhead.  One few over us and we could clearly see 3 lights in a triangle formation.  The lights looked read from a distance (almost like a ball of fire that has been contained).  They seemed to communicate with us on the ground & to each other through these lights.  The strange thing is that none of these large objects made any sound - we have the Airshow every April in Ft Lauderdale & it is extremely loud & noisy.  Furthermore, one object would stop & literallyvresemble a very bright star then wait for a few more to meet up & move together in unison.  No matter how many of these objects were in the sky at once... we watch from my balcony facing the intercostal an hour later - ! they never crossed paths. We took 5 videos on social media sho! wing pro of of these lights .  I watched other videos on YouTube & various news sources from others.  They look EXACTLY the same as ours.  This went in for 3 hours. Then we noticed they appeared to be landing behind the Las Olas bridge one after another. I would say without exaggeration at least 25-30 kept waiting them disappear and another one would show up. The oddest thing was before we left the beach there was a silent one that started water skiing it was also silent but had the 3 lights & it changed shape.  Since all we had were street lights... I could see waves follow it however it was completely quiet. Nobody water skis with only 3 small lights at 11pm.  That isvwhen they sharks come out. We know what we saw...  it was exhilarating yet mysterious.  We didn\u2019t feel that there was any harm meant for us.  Now with all these other sightings world wide I would like some answers please & Thabk You for reading my report if you made it this far.  Cheers.","1721":"Lights above the Gulf of Mexico On a drillship in the Gulf of Mexico.

The object was at about 60 degree elevation.  I observed it for a minute or so with my naked eye and it appeared to be similar to a satellite tumbling in space, reflecting the sunlight as it tumbled.  With my binoculars it appeared to have a linear shape but very thin, almost a sliver.  It appeared to moving very slowly to the east.  I observed it for a few more minutes when a passenger jet flew nearby.  It was obvious that the object was far above the jet's contrails.  After about 10 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated to the south for a short distance, then made a 90 degree turn towards the earth.  My house blocked further observation of the object.  The reason I am reporting this is because of the sudden acceleration and changes in direction the object made.   I saw all of this in broad daylight under mostly sunny skies.","1728":"Highly Advanced Aircraft sighting over the Cherry Grove Inlet in South Carolina So I live near the city of Myrtle Beach, SC, a large tourist area on the coast of the state. Cherry Grove is a small town on the north end of Myrtle Beach.  The Cherry Grove Inlet, which is where this incident occurred, is known for paranormal\/extraterrestrial activity and has been for decades. Since before I was born (I am almost 30) the locals living on or near the inlet have reported strange sightings.  At night randomly, with no consistency in pattern, numbers, or time of night, these globes of light appear in the sky.  The lights are a deep orange-red color.  The number of lights varies from 1-6 total (at least from what I've heard from the mouths of the locals and seen myself) and sometimes they appear in a \"triangular\" or \"pyramid-like pattern\".  Not every time. But sometimes.  They seem to appear more on nights when the moon is brighter, like tonight, and it is rare they behave the same way from one sighting to the next. When they appear, if you do witness their presence, they brighten and dim like theyre breathing. Brighter and brighter until theyre almost blinding, and then dimmer and dimmer until they are basically not visible anymore.  They hover for minutes sometimes, still and unwaivering, and then POOF they will disappear, only to reappear miles north\/south within that same second.  In the blink of an eye. Like lighting.  Sometimes they're high above the ocean, and sometimes they are right down over the waves.  I've seen them sway and flit and zip about, much like a housefly does when in flight.  I've seen them down over the waves, just barely above the waters crest, and watched that orange-red light seemingly melt off of them and rain down into the water. I've also been right beneathe them.  When the tide is lowest on nights when the moon is bigger you can walk over a mile out from the public walkway  where the inlet starts.  And one night at around 930, back in March, my daughters and I were all the way out as far as you can go on the pointe, and they appeared.  Right above our heads. It was beyond terrifying. I couldn't make out a shape.  Just 2 orange-red lights, a few feet apart, maybe 50-75feet over our heads.  They make no sound. None at all.  Quiet as a graveyard.  And they hovered there over us, the orbs \"breathing\" like they always do.  There was no movement.  They were perfectly still.  Absolutely no waivering or swaying whatsoever.  And as we ran for our lives it seemed, I kept looking back at them to see if they followed.  They did not. Once we reached the walkway over a mile up the beach, I turned around to catch one last glimpse before the disappeared altogether. The commonality with all the reports, and all my personal sightings of them (I've seen them more than 50 times in the past 8 years), is that they only ever appear at night. Until today. I saw them. I saw the ships. In broad daylight. I have multiple pictures.  I will include them all here so you can see exactly what I mean. These are supremely advanced aircraft.  It's hard to describe the shape.  But the best way to sum it up is they have a  pyramid-like body, not super tall just triangular, with a hull the scoops upwards from the bottom, and wings that jut out and downwards from the body of the craft.  There is a light directly on top of the ship, and one on either arm\/wing. It explains the triangular pattern that the lights sometimes appear in.  They are LARGE aircraft.  They were hovering at least 100 feet above the ocean, and probably a mile+ away from me over the water, yet they were clearly massive and robust in build\/structure.  I'd dare to say bigger than our biggest commercial aircraft. It was a little past 8pm.  My daughters and I were walking on the Intracoastal Waterway side of the inlet. The sun was starting to set and there was a gorgeous display of neon pinks and oranges and yellows on the clouds.  The moon was bright.  The backdrop of the sky had a rainbow effect. I had my Professional grade Nikon camera with me, as well as my phone, taking photos of the sky out over the dunes towards the ocean side of the beach, when I noticed a strange steel gray\/blue shape that stood out between the oranges and pinks of the clouds. Initially I thought it was a space in the clouds, and that it would move momentarily as the clouds drifted by on the wind.  It didn't move.  I locked my eyes on the shape as more of it appeared out of the clouds (again, it didn't move.  The clouds were moving at a decent rate).  That's when I realized there were 2.  The first one I noticed was closer, and far more exposed than the second, which hovered to the left and back away from the first one. They were still and unmoving.  As I wrapped my mind around what I was seeing it hit me what I was looking at.  With my eyes still locked, snapping photos as I moved, I ran through the dunes and back out onto the oceanside, never blinking or moving my gaze off these things. And once I got to the water's edge there was no denying what they were. I could see the wings, the scooped hull, the lights, the massive body and gray steel color. Aircraft like I'd never imagined before.  And they were right there in broad daylight hovering over a beach crawling with tourists. The look on my face as I stared up at them caught the attention of MANY of the other beachgoers.  Families with their children, elderly couples, another mother with her son, all tuned in and finally saw what I was seeing.  There was mild panic as many rushed off the beach, but I stayed there determined to see what these things would do. And just like that, as if they'd realized a decent amount of us had noticed them, THEY VANISHED.  To be clear, I know for a 100% fact they were still right there. They have an active camoflauge they use to blend in with the sky, like a cloak or shield, and they activated it once they realized they'd been spotted.  There is no other good explanation. Total time between when I initially spotted them, and when they finally \"vanished\", was about 12 minutes.  But I've seen these things for years. My family has seen these things since before I was alive.  And just based on what I know about them, I KNOW they were still there.  And I waited with my daughters for another hour to try and see if the lights of those ships would once again make an appearance.  They didn't. At least not while I was there. My father is the one who advised me to report this.  And here's why.   My father has been closer to one of these than I was that night the lights appeared right over us at the inlet.  But this happened at night.  My entire family and every local I've ever spoken to about these things has always said they only appear at night.  All the reddit threads and local posts I've read about these lights say they ALWAYS appear at night.  ONLY at night.  So upon telling my father that they were out and clearly visible in broad daylight he strongly encouraged me to reach out to the government BECAUSE if they went from being discreet and cautious about appearing only at night, to full blown daylight appearances over a crowded beach, SOMETHING might be about to happen.  Something bad. I've always thought, having watched them so many times throughout the years, that they were looking for something.  Why else would they stay over this 4-5 mile stretch of beach, and for decades at that?  Why else would they continuously range above the waters surface, back up into the sky, and then down again?  They have to be looking for something. Nothing else makes sense.","1729":"Lights in the Sky Form Triangle then Diamond then One by One Disappear over Los Angeles In the South by Southeastern sky, I saw between the moon and the brightest star what appeared to be another equally bright star, but then to the left and below it appeared two more lights equally as bright firming an equilateral triangle.

It was not an airplane or helicopter. It moved very fast and turned in 360 degree angles and then it went down behind the trees.  What is odd is that it was extremely far away then close then far then when it went straight down it was close enough to look like it was less than 10 miles away.

It was about 40 feet from the groud.  We could or see the structure well as the sky was black, just the lit box (with various colors) and an outline of the vessel.

There were two objects in the night sky moving north to south direction.  The first object was moving very fast, and there were no strobe lights like an airplane would have.  Then after a few seconds there was a 2nd object with the same characteristic as the first flying behind.  Same instance of flames from the back end.  You could see type of wing on both sides of where the flames were coming out of the back.  It wasn't balloons due to moving in a perfect straight line with no deviated course.  Around the back of the object seemed to be a white aura.   Shortly after these too went into the distance at fast speeds and no sound was heard. Another object of the same characteristic came out of nowhere and from NNE to SSW direction then disappeared shortly after.  As I have never seen this before and it was during the fireworks but it was way to high and going way to fast.  It was like a spacecraft or even unconfirmed space debris possibly.  But the strange thing it looked ! like it went out of the atmosphere due to the flames were directly showing only with the aura in a shape of wings.  There was no sound coming from these objects.  Very strange.","1747":"Passenger airplane has to make quick deviation to avoid collision with fireball shaped orb. I had just submitted a report about 15 minutes before we saw this last fireball light.  This fireball light was similar to the previous one I reported (fireball).  It lifted above the horizon from the northeast, and slowly traveled south before stopping in the sky.  We live close to Sea-Tac airport, and noticed it stoped in the flight path of departing airplanes to the west.   I filmed the object, and within 45 seconds a airplane came into the frame of video heading right towards the fireball shaped light.  As the plane approached the light, it made a obvious and deliberate deviation away from the light.  I have this on video.  The airplane left the frame of video, while the fireball light remained.  The light stayed visible for approximately 30 seconds more before vanishing.","1748":"I was on my way home from Bar Louie in Wesrminiter heading down rt. 36 to Boulder. About 4 minutes to Boulder I see a big, bright orange, fire ball floating low in the sky. I literally put my hazard lights on and pulled over on the major highway to get out and look at it. I tried taking a video and I thought it was going successful until I got back into my car and the video was messed up. I was shook and excited by the experience. The fireball moved quickly and was very close the the land-comparitively to any air craft. It also made absolutely no noise.","1749":"Red, green and white light flashing on and off.

It was triangle with 2 white lights close together and a blue light on one side and a red light on the other.   The craft seemed to be hovering, yet moving forward at a steady speed.

A couple minutes later two more objects appear doing the same thing and then vanish.  Incident lasted about 12 minutes, including one more object appearing.

Was about 25 feet into yard, looking back toward house.  Facing South.  Always look at stars but this time was shocked to see that there was a triangular craft, which was very lightly illuminated at the three corners and not very high, flying overhead at a speed that was undeterminable.   I think the illumination might have possibly been the lights from city of Milton (FL) and of surrounding subdivisions reflecting on the craft. Without that illumination the craft would have been nearly, if not completely, invisible.  As it was it was not something one would notice without being directly under the flight path I don\u2019t think.  It was flying from North to South and made absolutely no noise whatsoever.  As the craft flew over it appeared to turn in an South-Eastward direction.   At this point it almost appeared that it might have been three triangular craft flying in a format! ion which gave the appearance of being one larger craft.  The craft disappeared from sight as it turned but not because of distance.  I think because ground lights reflecting upward lost the angle which caused the craft to be highlighted.  Watched for it for about 10 more minutes but did not see it again.","1760":"Silent bright orange light in sky drifting, jumping and or teleporting Could have possibly been two craft but looked like one craft jumping around.  Orange light with no sound seen in the east.

I left my home in Saint Cloud, Minnesota around 3:50am.  I made it to county road 75 (goes through Saint Joe MN).  I was traveling west on co rd 75 towards Avon MN.  I was at the Coborn (grocery store) intersection when I noticed a bright orange light to the east side of the moon (was south of my vision).  The co rd is under construction, so I struggled to keep looking at the light because of it being narrow with cones on both sides.   I glanced 3 to 4 times at it and notice that not only had it moved several time, it had completely disappeared.  I continued west on co rd 75 towards the I-94 merge and just past the second Kwik trip (the last one before you leave town).   To my left (south of the road), I saw a GIANT, HUGE, MASSIVE (these words don't do the size of this craft justice) aircraft.  The craft seemed to be more square than rectangle and had 4 very distinct bright orange lights under the craft.  It hovered approximately 200 yards above the tree line and very clearly lit up the tree line and field.  It was completely silent and was not moving.   I was legitimately frightened and continued at a high rate of speed to work. This was between Saint Joe MN and the on ramp to I-94 just before exit 156.

At approximately 1:41 a.m, I was driving home after a late dinner\/early breakfast and saw a good sized yellowish orb of light slowly moving across the sky at cloud level.  I pulled off the road to observe.  Initially, it was a solid orb of light.   I watched it for a minute or two, then called my 20 year old using my cell phone.  I wanted her to go outside (from home) so she could see what I was seeing.  About 15 seconds into our 1 minute and 29 second conversation, the orb starting \"blinking\" on and off at something close to half-second intervals.  As we were ending our conversation, it blinked one more time and then disappeared completely. About 15 to 20 seconds after the last blink, a second faster moving craft appeared lower in the sky.  I couldn't quite make out its shape, but it had rapidly blinking bright red and white lights (almost like an ambulance), with a solid blue light in the center.  At the risk of sounding stupid, it appeared to be chasing the first object.  It passed behind a tree and I wasn't able to find it again.  I don't know if it also disappeared, or if I simply couldn't see it at this point. All of this took place in a span of about 5 minutes. I should probably also add that all four of the car's windows were down and I heard no sound coming from either craft. While not relevant to this incident, approximately 3 months ago, I experienced a somewhat similar event. I observed a bright white orb of light moving slowly toward me beneath the clouds.  After a minute or so, a smaller orb seemed to separate itself from the larger and move off to its right side.  It was immediately followed by a third orb which moved off to its left side, forming a somewhat sloppy triangle.  All three remained for another 15 seconds and then simply disappeared.  There was nothing to interfere with my view.  They were there, and then they were gone. These were also soundless.","1773":"Four objects gently floating in the sky At 12:45 4 objects were seen in the sky. The objects were completely black and seemed to float. They maintained proximity of each other. The best description would be something like a plastic bag floating or a very light burnt paper, but we could see they were definitely not bags or papers.

I called attention of my husband and it was also strange looking thing in the sky.  I brought the binoculars and saw a white bright ball in the sky going from south to north direction.  Then it changed its course to east.  It was jumping and mowing quite fast.  Then it was moving south and it disappeared in the distance.  I checked the sky for over the next hour looking for it.  I saw airplanes in the far distances and was able to see its wings so I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t airplane nor a bird.

They are bright white, as luminous as the brightest star in the sky, with no other lights present.  We have witnessed them passing overhead at high altitude and low, (they are completely silent).  We have also witnessed the lights stop, slow down, and accelerate in a manner not seen with 'regular aircraft. My wife and I are avid sky watchers, and as such, we are aware of the airports in the surrounding areas.  We are also familiar with satellites, and the varies commercial and military aircraft, (and how the ambient light can make them appear wingless, even distorted).  These lights are something else.  The easiest way to describe then is to picture a satellite in the night sky, then make it as bright or brighter than the brightest star, traveling at commercial airplane altitudes. Last night, (6\/17\/2019) we spotted what we thought was a commercial airliner heading NE, (towards Bishop International) flying so low through the late evening sky that you could almost make out its shape.  It had three incredibly bright white lights, fairly close together, but far enough apart to have a triangle shape.  As it passed us we clearly saw the back of the craft, where two small orange lights, (one on top of the other) were on its right, and a larger red light on its left.  The lights were not positioned like we are accustomed to seeing on commercial craft, and the flashing pattern was very different as well - the bottom orange light would flash, followed immediately by the large red light, then the top orange light would do a fast double flash, pause for a second, then repeat.","1784":"1round Orange Redish Ball.

He saw what he thought was an airplane but then took a closer look and saw what was flying mid-level in the shape of a triangle.  It was silent and had white and red lights.  I looked at it and we started freaking out.  It rose up a little bit and then flew at a semi-slow speed and it dropped a white ball of light.  It was so low that we could see the details and we know it wasn't a plane.  After that it flew right above the trees and disappeared.  Then, we saw it again in the distance and it was flying slow and then 10 seconds or less later it was higher in the sky than an airplane would be.","1813":"((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were sitting outside around 8:30 pm.  An airplane was traveling west to east in the sky.  It had a nice contrail behind it as it came across the sky. As it came across all of a sudden the aircraft AND the contrail disappeared.  It like faded away.  Was weird to witness. There was no clouds in the sky so it did not disappear behind a cloud.  It just literally faded away and disappeared. No sound, but normally with aircraft that high you do not hear them anyways. The sun did reflect off of it, but couldn't tell about any aircraft on the lights. I own a very good ads-b setup here at the house.  I quickly came to check out what aircraft it was.  And there was no aircraft on the adsb-b in this area at the time.  None that were traveling in the area or direction. So to put a long story short:  We witnessed an airplane flying in the sky from west to east.  I do not want to approx. the altitude.  But the sun was shining off the aircraft and had a strong contrail behind it.  Then it faded away above us, without a cloud in the sky.  The airplane AND the contrail just faded away and disappeared.  And there was nothing on my ads-b tracker. I did take a video of it with the cell phone.  But with it being a cell phone, I do not know how the quality will be. About us:  We frequently watch the skies and know what is normal in the skies.  We frequently watch the skies for the airplanes.","1820":"Objects were in groups 6 to 8 Seem to be oval in shape Orange light or beam was on the objects Objects were floating in groups  It was late night floating in sky.

I was facing West with the sun at my back.  I could see what appeared to be an airplane at a very high altitude moving fast.  There was no vapor trail.  The unusual part was you could not see any wings.  The aircraft UFO was moving fast but at such a high altitude, it had the classic \u201ccigar\u201d shape.  The color of the object was white.   Occasionally it would seem to be greyer.  It was so high there was no indication of flames, lights, windows, just a smooth cigar shape, no detail.  I am used to seeing the satellites at night such as the ISS and I am very familiar with military aircraft and commercial airliners they fly over our house all the time.  This time it was different it raced across the sky traveling from the North heading in a South (Southwest) direction.   The sky was mostly clear with a few clouds but this vehicle was different. Its path never varied and eventually I could not see it.  My daughter said she could still see it after I sai! d I could not.  I was hoping to see if anyone else happen to see it.

I called my 19 year old son to look and he saw it too.  I called the local police and 2 seasoned Smithville, Missouri, police officers came over and they saw the same \"light\" moving and then they saw multiple lights moving.  The lights looked like stars in the sky.  Three lights were in the formation of a large triangle.  There was another brighter light to the right of that triangle that was moving as well.  They were in the sky for some time, like 2 hours that I watched them.  The more I watched the sky, the more movement I saw of bright star-like objects moving.

They would go very dim, then get very bright again and go between circular, diamond and a blob like shape. Observer backgrounds- my spouse and myself very average people.

Bright light going in a circular motion then would leap out a short distance from where I first saw it, continue in a circular motion, leap back in the opposite direction and continue the circular motion.  Strange propulsion.  It was light orange in color.  The sky was mostly clear with very thin, scattered clouds.  An airplane was spotted in the vicinity of the object on a known flight path.  The duration of the sighting was approximately 5 minutes.  I ran in the house to grab my phone to record it, rushed back outside and object was gone.

Flashes continued at about 5-second intervals each with longer duration but diminished brightness until after 3 flashes duration was about 1 second and substantially dimmer than original flash.  The flashes then increased in brightness and shortened in duration until approximately identical to first flash.   Cycle was seen to repeat at least 4 times until too near zenith to keep in sight through window. Object appeared to move-drift almost due-eastward at approximately 10 degrees per minute - MUCH slower than ISS or Iridium satellites that I enjoyed observing until satellites were recently de-orbited.

Only catching the last glimpse of the light as it went out, I kept focused on the area the flash came from. Approximately 3 seconds later, another flash appeared, only this one was a bit lighter in intensity yet still very bright and only lasting 1 second before going out.  Another few seconds and another flash only this one was much less in intensity and still lasting about 1 second before going out.  The last flash came a few seconds later and it was hardly noticeable being very dim.  Then the show was over.

I usually wake up to that time since I am having trouble sleeping sometimes.  This took place around 2:26am, around this time.   I went to go to the bathroom.  I have a window in front of the toilet.  While doing my business, I look outside of the window. I am interested in astronomy, so I look up to the night sky.  I was looking at the stars, and I noticed a very peculiar star, which was brighter than others. It was lights.  From space, not like beams shooting up, but lights.   I first saw what it looked liked to be a star, a white-looking star, then another joined under it, and another under it.  The 3 stars formed in a line.  After about 5 seconds, they merged into one star.  Then the stars looked like it was making an unknown shape.  From what I saw, it looked like a teardrop but the tip was very curved.  I also noticed some sort of beam shining out of the UFO.  I also noticed a minuscule-sized aircraft flying around the light.  The small one was flashing green lights.  Then it faded into nothing.  Came back, then faded once more.  After the 2nd fading, the light never came back.   During this, I decided to go get my camera (I was amazed at the sight, but also still.  But I snapped myself out of it and tried getting the camera).  My camera couldn't take the picture of the lights, everything was too dark.   Keep in mind that that UFOs were at star-length.  They were as far away as if they were blending in with a star.","1839":"MADAR Node 137","1840":"On 6\/3\/19 at approximately 9 pm, two women were outside.

So does my wife and son.  It is pretty predictable.  On a clear night, go outside and look up.  It only takes a few finutes.  Sometimes as much as an hour at most to see them.  The way I like to describe them is this.  Imagine being on a stage with the ligths shining on you.  You know there is a huge crowd out there but you cant see them because you are lit and they are not right?  Then a single flashbulb goes off as someone takes a picture.  That is what it looks like.  A single flashbulb going off. It will then move a bit.  Not really far but it never pops in the same place. These things are NOT satellites since they are not moving at a steady rate which would be required if you were on orbit.  Also not an airplane as they are not moving properly to be flying and there is no sound associated with seeing them.  If you take the time to watch them they will flash in an area half a dozen times then, go away?  Then you will see some in another area. I have seen them near the ISS as it traveled by as well.  This is a good way to see them as well because they are almost always near when it goes by.  I encourage anyone seeing this to go look for them. I am at a loss as to how to photograph these things.  I totally would but it would take a bulb setting and all I would see is a white dot against a field of white dots (stars).  Not sure how to identify the flashers in a background of stars via a camera.  Perhaps with a bulb setting long enough it would be the white dot that was still a dot and not a smear like the stars would be?  IDK.  Not convincing to most people and not really worth the trouble.","1845":"illuminating blue light in the sky moving really fast and then disapeared I was sitting outside on my porch with a few friends talking like we always do and i have a tendency to look up and look at the stars at night when we are talking.  They didn't notice it but they all believed me because of my reaction its hard to fake, anyways there was a blue light that appeared behind some trees right at the top i could see the top of the circle but not the bottom.  The best way i can describe it would be that it looked like a spotlight from a helicopter only it wasn't shining in a particular direction just illuminating.   The light stayed at the top of the trees never leaving my sight and moved at what looked like normal aircraft speed across the top of the treeline until it just vanished.  No one believes me but i know what i saw so i called a friend the morning after and said something about it and they said they had seen a blue light too.  His description was the exact same as mine just in a different area.  I know for sure we both seen it because he is just as confused as me.

UNO Sighting in Houghton, Michigan, June 6, 2019   Around 90 minutes ago, I was in my living room and noticed that the sky outside  seemed unusually bright.  At first I thought the moon must be rising and causing that, but that was not the case.  The brightness was diffuse and I wanted to \u201cpin it down,\u201d so I locked my apt., which faces only east, and went outside the building to see if I could see a source in the western sky for the diffuse brightness. I immediately did see a source in the northwest quadrant of the sky.  It was a narrow strip of light, almost vertical but with a slight forward tilt of the upper portion, and a very slight curve (I believe) in the middle.  It did not seem to be moving.  It seemed to be just hanging there.  I stood and just stared at it for three or four minutes.  Then some clouds moved in front of it, and it appeared that it would be covered for quite some time.  It was chilly and late and I was alone, so I returned to my apartment and did not go outside again. Later, it occurred to me that there might be an internet site on which to report seeing something you have never seen before, so I called the phone number and spoke to a gentleman and he suggested that I submit this report.","1860":"Shape: peanut shaped color:white and only one.","1861":"Two bight objects slowly wobbeling across the sky before disappearing fast.

My wife, myself, and the neighbors we were visiting had just stepped outside onto their porch.  We were standing there talking about how great the weather felt and was looking at the stars.  My wife said, \"Do ya'll see that?\"  Our neighbor said, \"I am glad someone else is seeing stuff\".  Yet when I looked and my buddy we did not see anything and said its probably just an airplane or a bright star.  My wife said, \"There were lights and they did not look like airplane lights or stars.\"  I of course am, was, very skeptical and said (thinking she thought she saw a UFO), \"Well I don't see anything.\"   Then right in front of us, up in the sky, we witnessed these yellowish, orangish circles of light.  They appeared out of nowhere. First one, then another up and to the left of the first one, then they multiplied.  There were all the sudden three circles of lights above and two below.  Then the three upper circles of light merged.  The lower circles then combined to one.  The two upper circles then became side by side.  Then one moved quickly in front of the other in a straight like fashion. Then the lower circle of light disappeared, then the one above it, and then the last upper one disappeared.  Just like someone was switching the lights off.  And switching the lights off what exactly?  After seeing that, I sat outside of our home for quite a while.   Then all the sudden it looked like a shooting star fell and that was all I saw the remainder of the time I sat out there.  I must have stayed out there for a good four hours just looking in the direction where I saw the circles of light.  It was like something out of a movie, I have never seen anything like it.  It was a feeling of fear, excitement, anxiety all rolled into one.  I went inside my house and googled anything I could find on this kind of phenomenon, then watched hundreds of youtube videos.  Which lead me to the National UFO Reporting Center. I even called Peter at the center.  I was and still, am just trying to wrap my! head ar ound what I experienced.  This all happened in Artesia New Mexico which is 57 miles south of Roswell New Mexico.  Another reason I was so skeptical.  I have always thought it was a humongous scam, UFO's and Aliens.  I am not so skeptical any longer.  I know what I saw was no airplane, no star, no kind of technology, at least none I have ever witnessed before. I do have everything I explained recorded on my phone.","1863":"Bright unnatural light filled the sky. Was driving north on the turnpike when all of a sudden a bright light filled the sky, almost as if a flash of lightning expect it was sustained for at least 5 second, pulsating.   Then after a short break the same thing happened again, but brighter.   No storms where in the area, so it wasn\u2019t lightning. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Around 3:10am, I was outside on my back deck looking at the stars; I talked really quiet out-loud saying, \u201cIf there are any aliens up there please show me your space ship; Do something.\u201d   To the East moving from South to North I saw a moving object light up for two seconds; I said, \u201cThank you;  Please do it again.\u201d  About 1 minute later I saw the same thing this time North-East moving in the same direction.  It was like what people who see UFO\u2019s call a Power-Up but very short as if they only wanted me to see them.   The object appeared to be about 1 mile away from me; The light went from complete darkness to brightness, fading-in from small to large and fading-out from large to small; Hold your thumb and index-finger \u00bc-inch apart and then hold your fingers against the sky and imagine a bright-light about 1 mile away at that size  [That\u2019s about how large the light was at its brightest];  And the shape of the light was more oval shaped being wider on the left and right sides.","1866":"White beam of light scanning me like a book during the day playing tennis with my daughter This happened back in the beginning of January 2019 my daughter and I went to play tennis because the weather was nice and in the middle of our playing I noticed a white egg type craft hovering around our tennis court just off to the side about 400-500 feet up  and  then it came closer over head I asked my daughter if she could see that in the sky she said yes she could then I look up \u2026. I see a beam of white light shine down towards me and into my face I look up into the light and it was amazing I was in a beam of light that blocked all other light around it\u2026 I saw little stings of light moving horizontally all most like when you see dew drops on a spider web in the shining sun and there where moving left to right and right to left it was hard to comprehend what I was seeing but I still remember it vividly months later and it gives me goosebumps thinking about it now but I know it wasn\u2019t ours\u2026.After I looked up at the beam I felt like it read me and it only! took a few seconds then it left our sight within 5 seconds heading straight up","1867":"Driving on rt 183 north west   saw very very bright light in circle in night sky was clear sky  jan 4 1226 am  it was moving in same direction  and got very big stopped moving then shot up and gone OMG fast","1868":"Looking up from my patio, I first saw what appeared to be a bird hovering almost directly overhead.  Not a bird.  Appeared football shaped with dark triangles.  One on each side pointing outward.  I went to get my phone to take picture and noticed that a spherical object to the east.  Seemed to be in the vicinity of I-5.   I started videoing it because it was moving south toward the helicopter training base.  We had about a 7mph wind coming from the ocean.  Blowing east.  Object was moving quite erratic and seemed to be in and out of focus.  Tough to follow.  I watched the item move to what I can only surmise to be about 4 blocks south and blinked out.  No longer seen by me.  I seen NO training of helicopters on that particular evening.  When reviewing video frame by frame, I noticed another object appear for less than a second.  After magnification I seen a few items, mostly globes of different sizes.  Seemed to interact.","1869":"You cannot see them without the camera, I have pictures. There are strange flying objects in my field every night.  I have taken numerous pictures with a game camera. ((NUFORC Note:  Moving objects appear to be insects.  PD))","1870":"Boxy object flying in sky. On Feb 15, 2019 at 6:00pm, I was crossing the FM 3090 overpass on HWY6 in Navasota, Tx. Nearing the end of the overpass, getting ready to make a left to go southbound on the HWY 6 feeder, I notice a Cessna 172 style plane traveling parallel to the highway, moving roughly NW.  Looking behind the plane I see an object following in the same direction, maybe 8 plane lengths away. At first, I thought the plane was towing something, but realize the plane if going slightly faster than the object and leaving it behind. I make my left onto the southbound HWY6 feeder, pull over and open my sunroof to take some pictures. The object continued to move roughly NW in direction, making no sound. It appeared to be about the same size as the plane and was traveling about 1500 feet high?  Dark gray\/black in appearance, composed of multiple boxy segments. I took 5 pictures, and by that time it had traveled far enough that I couldn\u2019t get a angle through my sunroof to take anymore pictures.","1871":"I was laying in bed in my room and i happened to look up and see this oval\/egg shaped craft with no wings or tail or chopper blades.  It had a bright spot of light shining of its right side.  This day is the birthday of the internet and i wonder if that is why i saw it.  All i know is fiber optic cables tend to curl to the right and maybe that's why the light on the ufo was on the right side.  Thanks.","1872":"We seen 3 lights in the sky.. standing still in the air for minutes at a time.  Then they went into a triangle formation.  Then it look like the lights went to a single file line.  They were sitting in mid air over lakeshore drive which is a body of water.  This water strength into Lake Michigan.  This sitting was film out of a building on the 25th floor on lakeshore drive... The lights started to disappear one by one and then reappear.","1873":"Well, typical in Minnesota.  Another sighting.  This time I had the chance to pull out my phone.  Strange extremely bright light in the dark night.  Different than a star.  The first bright light moved across horizontally, then suddenly vanished.  Faded.  Disappeared.   After I was done recording the first bright light, I noticed a second brighter light.  As you can see in the second video.  Planes fly above us all the time and the that was most definitely not a plane.","1874":"High-altitude white dot over Sylvan Lake, Alberta.  It did a curly que upwards and vanished.  3 second sighting. After listening to your coast to coast report last night (April 18, 2019), I also seen a high-altitude white object in the sky.  Just a dot really. It than did a curly que up wards and went out of sight.  The sighting lasted only 3 seconds.  I was at a political event at a ranch and waiting for the main speaker.  I was focusing on an eagle or osprey very high up in the sky over the lake.  That is the only reason I seen it.  We were 1 mile from the south west edge of Sylvan Lake, Alberta, Canada.  This happened at 7 pm, April 8, 2019.","1875":"On April 9th, at 7:05 AM I left from my home in Grand Ledge for work In Lansing, MI, by the Lansing Capitol Airport.  Driving East on M-43 past M-100, past Nixon Road, and at just past Upton Road I noticed an odd rectangular shaped cloud at 10 to 11 o\u2019clock.  The cloud stood out because the rest of the clouds heading East where at the horizon and they all had a gray to purple color, time about 7:10AM.  The clouds did not block the sun since it was rising in the East. I thought the cloud was an airliner getting ready to land at the Lansing Capitol Airport because I thought the sun light was reflecting off the plane.  As I continued to the stop light at N. Market Place Blvd, I decided that it was not a plane, but I thought how odd this cloud was, rectangular shaped but the edges and corners were not sharp rather cloud like and white in color.  There was quite a contrast between the rectangular cloud and the clouds around the horizon.  The sky above the horizon was clear except for the white rectangular cloud.  The time was 7:16AM. I drove on and got on 96 West and did not notice the rectangular cloud at all.  I exited on Grand River Avenue heading East to where I work near the airport.  I drove past the Marathon pumping station and noticed the rectangular cloud again.  As I looked at while driving, I noticed that the cloud evaporated from the inside out.  I thought this was a very odd phenomenon.  I have never seen a cloud evaporate from the inside out before in my life.  The time was 7:20AM. No other airplanes were in the air.  Is this a normal aerial phenomenon?","1876":"Was driving west of Salinas and saw a dark-colored, cigar shaped craft in the sky staying still.  It then hid in the clouds. Was driving on road towards west of Salinas when we noticed a dark-colored, cigar shaped craft staying still in the sky yet moving slightly.  We kept an eye on it and it began to move and as it went higher and hid in the clouds.  About 10 minutes later we looked again and noticed that something got shot in the sky from what looked like the Moss Landing\/Santa Cruz  area.  It was a very eerie feeling.","1877":"MADAR Node 106","1878":"A object only seen the light fly across sky and hover over tree and then dips behind tree. Caught on video is a circular light that appears to spin at times and somewhat fades.  It flys slowly across sky and then hovers over a tree and then hides behind tree and pops in view a couple times, looks too big to be a drone.","1879":"White, boxy object spotted zooming through the sky, disappeared within seconds. My friend and I were sitting outside, when suddenly a shadow blocked the sun for a second, which alerted us to look to the sky.  When we looked up, we saw a white, boxy object zooming through the sky.  It was extremely high, moving extremely fast (we physically had to turn our heads to keep up with it), and flying out of sight within a few seconds.  There was no noise accompanying it whatsoever.  There were also no trails behind the object. I am someone who is skeptical of sightings but this has convinced me.  There could be no other explanation.  Far too high up to be a bird or plane, and it was flying faster than any plane i\u2019ve ever seen.   My friend is more of a skeptic than I am, but she also agrees what we saw has no other logical explanation.

Have witnessed several times, on clear starry nights; a star that moves at times in straight lines across the sky - and at other times in random circular patterns.  Visible to the naked eye, looks like a star. Have observed with binoculars as well.  Using the binoculars appears as though there are two stars (one larger - one smaller) , and upon closer inspection they at times circle each other.  When they are moving across the sky, one of the star appears to pull the other.  When the star moves in random circular patterns, the white dots circle each other.","1882":"It was a round bright object Look towards east coast and saw a bright round fireball.  The.  It moved and went sideways to the north.  I have video and pictures","1883":"At approximately 6 pm pst, my girlfriend and I were in our driveway looking up in the sky west about 5000 feet in the evening sky.  We witnessed 3 unidentified objects, one in middle being the larger escorted by two other smaller unidentified objects one to the left and one on the right having no lights and no sound and dark colored objects heading southeast traveling at an unknown speed and disappeared into the clouds beyond sight.","1884":"3 fireballs flying in a triangle. Kingwood, Texas, April 16, 2019.   Around 8:30 pm I was walking my dog when I saw three bight orange\/red fireballs flying in a triangle.  two more followed but separately.  I live 10 miles from a major airport.  I see and hear planes all the time.  This was no plane.  I heard nothing.  They did this twice. Unfortunately.  I didn\u2019t have my phone with me to film it.  This was my first time to ever see anything like this, I hope I do again.","1885":"MADAR Node 105","1886":"Surprised to see black triangles in my pics that i didn't see with own eyes. I was taking pictures of crazy looking clouds and an airplane.  I kept seeing dark shapes behind the clouds.  When reviewing pictures i saw i got pictures of more than one black triangle.","1887":"We were heading east toward Ellsworth when we saw what appeared to be a mile or so away, not terribly high in the sky, 4-6 orange orb or sphere like balls.  They appeared to line up and then one by one began to disappear, one after the other.   Moments after the last one disappeared, we saw one less illuminated, take off North at an incredible speed.  Much faster than ANYTHING I have ever seen.  That was it, happened approximately over a 15-20 second period.  Ironically, as we drove away, there were LOTS of planes flying in many different directions no different than any other night or day.  NONE of which were near this event at the time it occured.","1888":"Where and when:  On the evening of April 17, 2019, at around 8:10PM, my wife and I were driving north on Arizona highway 77 (Oracle Rd.) about a quarter mile south of Eagle Crest Ranch Blvd. when my wife said \u201cwhat the heck is that\u201d and pointed to the sky up ahead. What we saw and for how long:  We both saw five goldish looking lights, about 40 degrees above the horizon lined up horizontally but tilted slightly,  The left most light was significantly brighter (about as bright as a car headlight from a quarter mile away) than the others.  The distance was hard to judge but I would guess between 2 and 3 miles.  They appeared to be drifting slowly to the west (left) and all of a sudden they just disappeared, as if a light switch was turned off. We saw these lights for about 10 seconds before they disappeared. What we didn\u2019t see: We didn\u2019t see the lights appear, other than when we noticed them, so we can\u2019t vouch for how long they were visible. We did not see a craft or crafts that may have been emitting the light.  There were no blinking lights associated with them, as seen on normal aircraft; in fact as we continued to drive north, about a mile and a half past the original sighting, we did not see any aircraft in the area at all.  The lights did not behave like fireworks, military aircraft flairs, drones or shooting stars, all of which we have seen many times. About us: I am an Engineering Technician\/Metrologist and my wife is a teacher.  We are both sky watchers and have witnessed many unusual things in both the daylight and night skies.  We both try to think of logical explanations for anything that we experience but we can\u2019t explain what we saw.","1889":"This happened in Bloomington, MN.  I was driving on hwy 77 going north, just coming up to the side of the Mall of America. I had a friend with me sitting in the front passenger seat. All of a sudden I shouted \"WOAH!\" at which point he stated, \"I saw that too!\"  Which really shocked and excited me that he did, because I am usually alone when I see strange things in the sky, or people I am with just don't ever see what I do, most likely because they aren't paying attention, and as for me, my eyes are always in the sky!  Even this time my friend wasn't really paying attention and kept looking at his phone but this object was so bright and low to the ground that it caught his eye.  I'd say it was at around the hight of the Mall of America.  Which would be illegally low for a plane to be flying. The object made no noise at all and I'm not sure how to explain the shape of it with one word but it looked semi-long, cylinder shaped with round edges in the front and back. Idk if you call that cigar shaped or what.  It was VERY bright and glowing a neon green and blue-ish like meshing together.  Looked like something that glows in the dark but brighter than any glow in the dark toy thing I've ever seen. It was traveling north, the same direction I was and it came about very fast, seemingly out of no where.  It was like its cloaking mode malfunctioned or noticed we saw them at which point it did not get far at all ahead of my car before it just vanished right in front of us, just dissapeared so I don't mean it vanished out of view. It just plain old vanished right before our eyes!  About a month after that event, I saw the same exact looking object do the very same thing, and also not too far away from the first time, but I was driving alone. So a few weeks go by and just last night I was at work (which is with-in just a few miles of the other events) and I hear my co worker talking to someone explaining what she had seen fly right above her while she was standing outside our work having a smoke and that the thing had vanished right before her eyes, right before looking like it was going to fly right into these apartments, and she described it looking exactly as what my friend and I saw. So needless to say I hopped in that conversation real quick haha. These 3 events all happened in the same area within 5 miles of eachother.  It is right near the Minneapolis-St Paul airport but we know what planes look like and this thing was most definetely no plane I have ever seen. I'm sure I will see it again sometime.

The lights would tend to turn on\/off 1 at a time, were perfectly spaced out between each other and in a perfectly straight line.  The lights would fade when they went out.  I then noticed 1 orange light much further down the beach that was turning on and off at the same time the 3 orange lights were turning on and off - looked to be communicating with each other.  Saw this happen 3 different times with the lights going out for a minute or 2 before doing the on and off sequence again.  Saw the lights appear slightly further down the beach the 3rd time indicating it moved while the lights were out..  The last time I saw the lights they appeared much further out into the ocean far away from the beach which indicated to me it had left the area.  There were never any sounds coming from the lights, just hovering perfectly still.  Because this was against the black sky, it was hard to tell what was around the lights.  At one point, I felt I saw an outline of an object.  Here is a link to a video that another person posted from that evening - this is the UFO that I saw and I can say is a legit video: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fJd2j3IzzAs  My view of the object was much better than what is in this video, I was on the beach and in front of the object that was out just a bit over the ocean.","1892":"I was driving home from work and witnessed 2 disk shaped objects hovering.  Noticed a long rectangular bright white light on one which appeared to be closer to I-75 and was able to make out a disk shape more.  The other object was hovering and just able to see flashing lights hovering.  Was able to take 2 quick pictures as I got closer and realized what I was seeing.","1893":"Fast, silent Mystery Craft. I went for a walk the night I witnessed this- it was the second time I have seen this thing.  It's large. It's SILENT.  And it moves like a greased rocket engine sometimes.  This thing seems to have a table shape to it, or it's a large helicopter shaped thing.  Where there is a red light in the video, the time I saw it before- there was a bright blue light dead center of the dark shape in the middle. There are 4 lights on the...legs.  It gives off the impression of a flying coffee table. Did I mention it is SILENT. I have footage of it (it is crummy, but, it's footage). You can hear the traffic down past the TV tower, you might be able to hear the cessna flying right over my head. You can really hear me snarl at the damn focus.  You'd think something as big as it is, flying at the speed it seems to be going, would make some noise. Nope.  The Cessna droning along was the only noise I heard, and that was weak. It's Unidentified (help!), it's Flying, and it's an Object. I am so on the fence as to what it is, my pants have creases.  If it made noise- helicopter. Both times, with the second time of me being dramatically closer, and no noise. I have very, very good hearing. I listened for all I was worth when I realized how quiet it was- Nada. I think it disturbed the air as it went by. If this is some secret military thing, whoever is flying it should be shot. I'm waiting for one of these hotshots to hit the stupid TV tower. They get THAT CLOSE.","1894":"Two objects, one with the structure and one just a light moving over our neighborhood then apparently chased away by jets.

As I got closer to the park I realised the light was moving to the west.  It was a constant red color and flashed with intensity of the same color.  As I got closer I could see it was about 100 feet off the ground and moving slowly westward.  At one point it was nearly over the top of my automobile.

On April 19th my dad and I witnessed a possible UFO in the sky.  My dad and I went to go play tennis and arrived at a park with several tennis courts at 5:00.  We played until my dad pointed out a shape in the sky.  He told me to come over and look up.  I looked and saw a black oval.  My dad thought it was a balloon until it started blinking blue.  We then thought it was a drone hovering in the air.  It stayed in place for a little until I looked away for a second and it was gone. My dad said he saw the \u201cdrone\u201d give a big flash of blue light and disappeared.  We started speculating to what we witnessed.  We thought the idea of a drone flying away really fast in a split second was unrealistic. \tLater a jet flies overhead towards where the \u201cdrone\u201d was.  For the next several minutes helicopters fly in the same direction.  A news helicopter, a red helicopter with white letters, and a red and black one all fly by in that direction.

My son and I were playing tennis at Memorial Park (1150 NW 36th St, Oklahoma City, OK 73118) on April 19th, 2019.  It is an azure blue, cloudless sky with light north winds and was approximately 67 degrees Fahrenheit.  My son was on the south side of the court facing north and I was on the north side facing south, and the sun is directly to the west of us at about 60 degrees.  I\u2019ve included a Google Earth Map image of our line-of-sight (UAP-1.png). Off to my left side (southeast) in the background right above the tree line at about 40 degrees (the tree line is roughly 250-300 feet from us), I see a bright blue flash and look in that direction (UAP-2.png).  My first thought is that someone let go of a blue Mylar helium balloon, and that I\u2019m seeing the sun\u2019s light reflecting off the surface.  I point at it and tell my son exactly that.  It moves from east to west (left to right from my viewpoint) and passed behind the trees so he doesn\u2019t see it at first.  He backs up to the net as I move up to it and point in the direction.  I tell him it\u2019s about to pop up from behind the tree and it does.  Only this time it has moved closer (at about 45 degrees) and is a black oval with two intermittent synced blue flashing lights on either side.  It stops moving in the sky (UAP-3.png).  Movement from point to point was approximately 12 seconds. So now we think we are looking at a drone, but it is really way up in the sky, and doesn\u2019t have aircraft navigation lights of red and green, just the dark, but bright blue similar in color to Dell computer system lights.  The blue is darker than the blue sky but also brighter than the sky when they flash.  It stops directly above the trees (but not actually above the tree because it is obviously way in the background behind it). Then it flashes brighter than any of the other times and it winks out and disappears (UAP-4.png).  My son says, \u201cWhere did it go?\u201d Puzzled by how a drone could just disappear, I pull out my phone and note the time.  It\u2019s 5:37 PM CST.  We continue searching the sky for about another twenty seconds.  Granted, from the time I saw the first flash and it disappeared was only about thirty seconds.  So almost a full minute from the first sighting, at 5:38 PM CST, a jet races from the east to west on about the same plane as the object and makes a bank toward us going north and flies a loop right around where the object disappeared so that it ended up flying back to the east in the same direction it had come from.  The plane was high enough that I could not make out what it was or how many engines it had.  It was too fast for a prop plane.  The plane itself actually gave us perspective the size of the oval.  At first when we thought it was a drone, I was thinking that it was two or three feet across.  However, after seeing the jet in the same place in the sky, the oval had to be the size of a car because it was s! lightly smaller than the jet.  The jet leaves the same way it came (UAP-5.png). We realize that with all the people at the park playing tennis and basketball around us, we are the only ones to witness this in the sky.  We keep watching the sky to the southeast.  At 5:43 PM CST, directly behind us coming from the northwest, a low flying red with white trim helicopter (300 or 400 hundred feet above us) races overhead in the same direction as where the oval disappeared (UAP-6.png).  It moved so fast that it cleared us and was gone in about three seconds.  Fast enough that we could not make out what was written on it.  The only two helicopters that I\u2019m familiar with in this area that are that color are a news channel helicopter and the med-flight helicopters used by hospitals. At 5:51 PM CST, a second helicopter, one farther west of us, also flies to the southeast in the direction where the oval disappeared.  This one is the KFOR Channel 4 News helicopter.  I can read it clearly on the side and it takes about ten seconds for it to come into view and cross the sky out of view heading southeast. At 5:55 PM CST, a third helicopter, this one\u2019s way farther east of us and heads to the southeast in the same direction as the others.  This one is black with red trim, but is too far away to make out who it belongs to. As each incident occurred, I noted the time, descriptions, and directions.  I did not get any photographs as everything happened so quickly, but I logged it all in my phone to refer back to later.  It could be completely coincidence and that none of this is connected.  I could not find out any info regarding why these choppers were heading where they were going.  There was no stormy weather for storm chasing. I have included drawings where I have recreated to the best of my knowledge keeping the proportions as close as I remember them to be. The resolution is high enough that you can zoom in on the areas and see the details and colorings of the object. As a side note, Tinker Air Force Base is in Midwest City and in the vicinity southeast of Memorial Park in Oklahoma City about 15 miles away.  My guess is that what we saw was even farther south than the military base.  Will Rogers Airport is in Oklahoma City and is southwest of Memorial Park by ten or so miles.  Having said that, we are used to seeing all kinds of planes coming and going all the time, and even the occasional drone.  I don\u2019t know what this was.  I\u2019m not calling this a UFO, through it certainly is an UAP to me.","1905":"Bright star-like object seen moving east to west over the Los Angeles area around sunset.

The object was very high in the sky \u2013 well above the flight path of planes returning to LAX.  The object was moving west.  It did not change direction.   Once I arrived home, approximately 4 minutes after my initial viewing, I spotted the object. I continued westbound and slowly faded into the sunset.

So we were driving over the bridge and watching the helicopter we were just in go up the river, when suddenly this white sphere looking thing appeared in the air (like it just blinked into existence) and was spinning it was about a 1\/2 city block from the bridge and hanging over the water, about the size of a geo metro (weird comparison I know lol) it suddenly expanded and started to resemble a wheel with bicycle spokes it was still spinning (clockwise) and had this swirling like mass in the center of it. the wheel, spokes and mass were all a white\/grey color and I instantly thought \"OMG its a dimensional portal opening!!\"  I slowed down as there was nobody else on the bridge (which was kinda weird at this time of day) and it expanded to about the size of a basketball court (another weird comparison lol) either way it was huge. and It stayed this size for about 5 seconds. then like stopped spinning and went in reverse and started shrinking in size back to the geo metro size it started with and then got smaller and blinked out of existence. we all saw this object, and once it disappeared I drove down to sit under the bridge to see if it would come back and it did not. while we were down there I made everyone draw what they saw and we all compared drawings and it was weird cause my kid saw some kind of symbols within it.

At first, I saw what appeared to be a regular airplane, as seen from a distance, flying diagonally upward and leaving a trail of smoke in its path.  Looking closer, I noticed there were three smaller, thinner horizontal trails of light beneath this larger light.  Next to the \"airplane\" was another large light, which looked like a fireball with a trail of light behind it.  It, too, was flying upward at first, but then switched direction, looking like it was facing the direction of my house.  It also changed color, from yellow to red, before changing directions again (heading downward). Over the course of approximately 15 minutes, these five lights shifted directions several times.  At one point, an airplane was flying toward one of the lights, and as soon as the airplane got too close, the light vanished. Eventually, the lights began to disappear.  Some dived into the horizon while others simply faded away.","1917":"I was outside on my porch skywatching, and after asking if any ETs were around tonight, to show me they are here and within seconds one flashed bright enough to get my attention.

April 20th, 2019, around 8:45PM EST, we were driving on Highway 21 towards the city of Troutman, when we witnessed a lot of strange lights hovering towards the north, some 35 degrees above the horizon.  At some point, we could see between 15 to 20 distinct lights.  It was an incredible sighting.   When we finally found a safe place to park the lights started to disappear and we did not even have a chance to take a decent picture of it.  The lights were moving slowly and randomly, mostly hovering below the lowest clouds and some of the lights even seemed to have entered the clouds.   The METAR for the nearby Statesville Airport reported scattered clouds as 3000 feet and broken clouds above 4500.  By estimating that the lights were a mere 3000 feet above ground and on a 35 degree above the horizon from us, I estimate them to have been hovering above the Murdock Rd area, between interstate 77 and Barium Springs.\u00a0  Our position as observers was at 35\u00b041'25\"N 80\u00b052'07\"W.

The further I drove, I realized how close I was to it.  The best way I could describe it was a flying object with multi-color, sequential and changing LED lights.  The lights changing colors was hypnotizing.  The ufo was low enough for me to realize I was driving under it, and then past it.  It was slowly hovering over the highway.","1922":"Triangle with 3 lights moved quickly and quietly across the sky. A friend and I were walking around town because of the nice weather; it was late enough that the stars had come out.  We're both college students in our early 20s.  I was open to the existence of UFOs, but my friend had been a skeptic until the event. As we were walking, we reached an area void of streetlights (near E 4th St and Oregon Ave) and my friend was trying to find some constellations.  As he was looking, he exclaimed, \"Dude! Look.\"  I looked up just in time to see a triangular shaped craft with three lights fly silently and quickly over our heads and across the sky before flying off into the distance, heading South-West. There were no trees, so we both got a clear view of the craft.  Neither of us were certain how large or how high the object was, but it appeared perhaps around 250 feet in the air and around 20 feet long.  It flew fast enough that we were only able to watch it for around 5 seconds.  We were both confident the object was some sort of UFO.","1923":"Three expanding\/moving lights One very bright white light over the top of a mountain, another smaller one next to it that was moving around (occasionally hides behind the big one) and an orange light that would disappear and re-appear closer to the ground than the other two and was moving a lot.

I was the passenger and was watching a small jet flying above the mountains in the same direction as we were going.  It was obviously moving much faster and was increasingly going further east with each second.  It was leaving a short jet condensation trail that quickly evaporated.   Suddenly I saw a bright reflection off of a second aircraft that was flanking the jet and in what could be considered the \u201cdriver\u2019s side blind spot\u201d which was on the left side of the jet but behind it.  Neither I, nor my spouse, could see the outline shape of the second flying craft, but could only see it as a \u201cspot\u201d of sun glaring off something metallic.  It had just suddenly appeared in the sky and was keeping exact pace with the fast moving jet, HOWVER, it was not leaving any condensation trail behind it like the jet was.  It doesn\u2019t seem reasonable that it could have be! en a non-jet engine plane due to its speed.

It flew east up over the other building in our condominium complex then quickly veered south towards the Naugatuck State Forest at great speed.  I continued down the hill with my dog to the end of our road.  At that point, an unmarked single rotor black helicopter flew towards the Naugatuck State Forest following the path of the object.

Eight appeared to be in a random figure with one quite a distance in the South that was moving faster to catch up with the group.  They appeared to be about 60 degrees off the horizon.  They eventually moved in a group North and after 10 minutes disappeared into the night.  They were as orange as the fruit and moved in synch with each other.","1955":"A bright green light came from the east qnd went down in the west","1956":"This was a sighting at night above Palm Desert, CA. featuring an angular object from which four other objects flew away and came back. Last night I was sitting in my hot tub and facing due east so the jet of water could hit my lower back.  My husband had already gone inside, so I was alone and staring up, hoping to see a meteor.  I heard something that caused me to moved my gaze straight up and I saw something moving fast -- it was huge, moving fast, and intermittently visible.  It was like a ship whose cloaking device was sputtering.  The object was not lit, but it seemed like it was reflecting the light from the cities below. It was flying higher than planes coming into PSP airport, but below the level of planes flying from LAX to the East Coast (which one can still hear and see with their flashing lights).  In the distance it seemed to suddenly stop, and then four or five separate objects flew away from it for a few seconds and then they flew back and merged with the object, and then the object suddenly seemed to fly straight up really fast and disappear. Honestly, it could have been a stealth bomber flying out of March AFB in Riverside -- they probably don't publish their training missions so it would be hard to verify.  It is not impossible that the objects i saw flying away from it could have been panels reflecting city lights.  But it didn't seem to behave like a bomber would -- streaking across the sky, making a bit of noise but then no more noise, suddenly stopping and disappearing and appearing, and then suddenly streaking straight up.  I did not see any trails or exhaust or jet engine plumes that a fighter might make, but I don't know how the B2's mask those. I have seen B2's fly in the skies above So Cal during events like the Rose Parade, and this didn't look like that and it certainly didn't behave like that.  At that hour, around ten thirty at night, it was very dark and the moon was not visible.  The Coachella Valley is in the desert but it is fairly heavily developed so there is considerable light pollution.  There are plenty of undeveloped areas around, so if the AF wanted to fly training missions, why would they fly right over a populated area with a busy airport?  I ran inside and told my husband what I had seen to try to keep \"contemporaneous notes\" and to try to explain and understand what I had seen.  I was in a hot tub thus didn't have my phone at hand to take any pictures (and probably wouldn't have had the time anyway).  Needless to say I have never seen anything like this before and have never filed a report like this either.","1957":"Triangle, white centerish area with rainbow emitting from it to shape the triangle Shape of a right triangle, with a white light in the central area and rainbow emitting from the white light, forming the shape of the triangle.

The size of the orb or silver sphere was estimated as \"about the size of a basketball\" with a reflective surface (as \"glimmers of the sun\" were perceived).

My friend and I were watching the sunset over the mountains when we noticed a sphere shaped objects that was over the mountains.  According to the map that was at the lookout we where in the object was floating above the East Pond trail.   At first we thought the objects could\u2019ve been a planet until a plane was starting to get closer to it.  At that moment it appeared that the object started to pulse, then fade.  The pulse moved on the object in a constant rhythmic pattern from one side to the other.  The fad away also started on the same side and moved in such a way.  After the event I made sure to get a photo of the location with a time stamp of 19:41.  Unfortunately, the object was to far away for me to get a photo of it, but this event will always be remembered.","1960":"Bright flashing light zooming toward earth. While driving North on R63 towards Des Moines, both passengers saw a flash of a bright light on the horizon.

We saw this in the dark NE horizon, in the rural countryside before Fleur Drive. We tried to explain it away by saying it was a falling star exploding in the earth's atmosphere, but both witnesses agreed that it was strange that the \"star\" seemed to hover for a moment like an airplane or aircraft, and then shoot with impossible speed to the ground. One of the witnesses did not believe in UFOs before this event.  Now they shrug and say \"maybe.\" ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was over the trees, rotating very slowly and following a non-linear path, I tried to get a clear view of it, however, it was further away by the time I did.  I estimate the it was about 200 feet above the trees and about 200-300 wide.  It was not a dronex not a blimp, not a helicopter or plane.  It moved too slowly and meandered.

It was a circular object which hovered and moved diagonally, up and down.  My son also thought it was emitting beams which could faintly be seen when the clouds were thinly moving through.

I\u2019m pretty sure it was the highest point on the way up the mountain.  Out of nowhere we see this light in the distance that just looks like a normal light in the distance.  I give an assumption that it\u2019s either a planet or just a really bright star.  However, as we look an just talk about what possible planet it might be we see an aircraft with a pretty obvious chemtrail goin in the direction of the light.  As that aircraft grew closer to the light it started to do something strange. The closer the aircraft got to the light it started to do a weird shift in brightness.  As if though the light saw what was approaching.  The light started to shift in some sort of pattern like a kind of blinking.  That\u2019s when me and my friend thought something was strange.  We were joking around because we thought it was normal but then it started to pulsate an slowly vanished. The longer I looked to the sky the less I could believe what just happened.  As quickly as we realized the light was there it vanished.  The only thing I could think of that may have obstructed our view was a very small cloud.  However even then I waited to see if this light may return. It did not.  My eyes couldn\u2019t believe what happened.  The light was there one second and as if it was spinning it faded slowly away.

There\u2019s still a lot of snow pack so you can\u2019t get up above the lake very easily, and most everybody had cleared out of there by the time the sun went down.  As far as I know we were the last people to leave, and it was almost dark.   As we were walking back from the shore towards our car, we heard a weird, low humming sound coming from the lake.  It was the kind of thing you might not even normally hear, except there was no noise or people or wind up there at all when it started.  We turned around and saw a flashing multi-colored sphere of light hovering about 50 feet off the lake, further towards the back of the lake near the cliff wall.   We both saw it at the same time and wondered if it was some kind of flare hanging in the air, but it didn\u2019t look fiery and it wasn\u2019t smoking.   My friend was wondering if it was the light of a climber on the cliffs, but we could see light strobing off of the sphere and flashing against the cliff wall so it was definitely hovering in the air and throwing off light around it.   It lasted for only a few seconds then it vanished again, along with the humming sound.  We weren\u2019t freaked out by it or anything, but we\u2019re still not sure what we saw that evening.

We concluded that the movement of the two lights was too smooth and uniform to be two separate drones, too fast, agile and quiet to be one large one (6-8\u2019 wide drone??) and the speed at which it turned 180\u00b0 was possible for racing drones but not for anything of size.  Other possibilities we considered was some sort of light phenomenon, thinking maybe it was headlights hitting moisture in the air in just the right way, but it was very clear and cool with no moisture in the air. We eliminated theories until we had two possibilities left\u2026 something we don't know exists or an ET UFO.","1997":"Saw flashing object for 45 minutes flying in a rough triangle pattern in a very tight pattern flash very bright and then very dim.","1998":"Weird light &quot;dancing&quot; at aprox 30K feet up during commercial flight from IAD to MHT It was about 11PM, and based on how long we'd been in the air, my guess is we were over cental NJ.  We would have been at cruising altitude, so my guess is 30K feet or more.  I saw a light that caught my attention out my window.  I was on the starboard side of the plan, so East\/Northeast would have been the direction I was facing.  This light was solid.  At that altitude planes don't have their landing lights on, only flashing markers.  So that seemed weird, especially as the light wasn't losing altitude.   Anyhow, the light starts to \"dance\" if you will.  Shooting straight up, then dropping quickly.  Moving rapidly from left to right.  It seemed to grow a bit more intense and I noticed a second red light next to the white one.  Both part of the same aircraft it seemed.  But again, it was solid, not flashing.  Again the light started moving around.  My plane was steady, so it couldn't have been an optical illusion where the light was steady, but we w! ere moving.   Anyhow, this continued for about 5 minutes or so and then it just disappeared.  My first thought was that maybe it was a military plane practicing maneuvers.  But that wouldn't happen there and definitely not at that altitude.  That's the busiest air corridor in the US, so the FAA would never allow it.  Plus, even military aircraft would have to follow regulations for no solid lights except for landing...","1999":"Neon pink and blue fireball Driving home headed west, seen a large bright pink fireball, with blue on the end, followed by smoke trail headed towards the earth.  It was very close, no noise heard.   Lost sighting, due to hill.","2000":"Fireball that changed directions and vanished It was around 3:00 am, and I was on my way home from avengers endgame, after talking with my friend.  I was in between Waite Park, MN, and St Joseph, MN, when I noticed a fireball almost like it was falling towards the earth, (if I have a distant away from me I would say 10-15 miles out and the fire ball was about the size of a quarter from my perspective so it had to be pretty huge and had a tail from my distant about 3 inches long) then out of nowhere the fire ball shot up in the opposite direction and vanished.","2001":"Observed a fast pace faintly lit orange colored unknown object in the night sky... SOURCE OF ACTIVITY:  On April 27, 2019, at approximately 0351 hours in the City of Bullhead City, Arizona (Mohave County)  I REDACTED: I stepped out of my residence pedestrian door facing a southern direction to \u201cget some air\u201d while observing the nightly lit shy with a clear and unobstructed view, I  immediately observed a unknown aerial object moving at a extremely fast pace. OBSERVATION:  I REDACTED stepped out of my residence pedestrian door which faces a southern direction, to \u201cget some air\u201d immediately observed a faint then at times brightly orange colored object, that I first believed was a star, then begin to move in a very fast rate of speed. Based on my digital calibrated cell phone compass, the unknown orange colored object was observed from my point of view in a south southeastern direction at 100 to 120 degrees, based on digital compass bearing heading, while I was standing outside my residence pedestrian door in a southern direction. The unknown object appeared to be moving in a northern direction from a south southeastern point of view. The unknown object was at first extremely faint or not visible while I was spontaneously looking at the night sky. The unknown object then became more visibly lit, appearing orange in color, yet mixed but not twinkling like a star, but more steady or a type of solid visible light. The unknown object begin to originally appear \u201cfaint\u201d then more illuminated, and was moving like a distant slow moving plane, then instantaneously accelerate in speed, nothing like a fast moving plane or normal type of plate or jet I would anticipate as adult with common sense, articulation, judgment and intelligent observational analysis with 2020 eye vision \/ healthy normal eyes and overall health. The unknown object speeded up so abruptly in a northern direction, that it quickly dissipated into the darkly night lit sky, lasting for approximately five (5) to ten (10) seconds in observation. I then stood outside for approximately ten (10) minutes to further observe the \u201ccalculated\u201d trajectory based on time and observation, of the unknown object would further appear or make itself visible, and met with negative results, while fully observing the clear night sky from north to northeastern to south southeastern observation. ADDITIONAL\/DISPOSITION OF OBSERVATIONAL ANALYSIS:  I have lived in major metropolitan city for most of my life and I am aware that \u2018light pollution\u201d obstructs a lot of stars in the night sky.  After living in Bullhead City, Arizona, a somewhat rural town of about 40,000 in population, the light pollution I would say with common sense is 1\/10th of that compared to a major metropolitan city which would be the full 10th scale of light population. No doubt, what I observed was anything I can explain or understand.  The only reason I was able to observe such a fascinating occurrence, is because the light pollution is at a minimal. I hope wherever this report \/ log is submitted to, serves the individual or organization well, thank you.","2002":"Bright light seen tracking an airplane, joined by another light and then disappears. Looking north from my backyard into the clear blue sky, watching the planes in the distance just coming from DIA, I noticed a circular bright light a distance behind one of the planes and it kept the distance the same for about 5 minutes.  It didn't look like a plane so I got out my binoculars and it was a round bright light, yellow and orange in color.  It then proceeded to go higher into the atmosphere and was joined by another bright orange\/yellow light and they seemed to stay apart, then come together, then apart and then after a minute or so they just disappeared.  I would guess the planes from my backyard were about 25-30 miles north of me.  The bright lights seemed to be about 1\/4 of the size of an airplane.  Thought they might be drones, but would have to be quite large for me to have seen at this distance.","2003":"They were all in a row and hovering over Henderson 1 had red lights flashing the other two had 1 red light and white lights.

At first, there were only three of the crafts.  Then later we observed a total of 5.  The crafts  appeared to be oval in shape, they were balls of light, they were opaque in color, they appeared fuzzy and not bright yet they were lit up.  They started out as three crafts that were doing maneuvers in a synced motion in the sky.  After several minutes two more appeared making a total of  five.   There were four of us who observed the activities of these crafts for a good total of 15 minutes.  The activity, we tried to get on video, but it was not showing up on the phone screen.  The synced activity was that these crafts appeared to be Zooming back-and-forth very high speed in the sky.  They were going from a south to north direction and then from north to south.  Then they would go from west to east and then east to west, and then they would circle amidst each other.  Then these crafts would fly directly over our head and then zoom back down towards a southerly direction.  The following day we saw numerous reports online that many others had seen the same lights in our area.  These crafts and lights made no noise.  They were very quiet.   After observing these lights for quite some time we observe that they were making a specific synced pattern in the sky.  The beams of light seemed to be coming from above as there are no lights or beam shining from down to up.  The lights would\u2019ve been coming from above. These lights circled each other.  They were making criss-cross patterns.  Then they\u2019d fly directly above our heads making maneuvers.  Please investigate the siting of these crafts.  Thank you","2009":"Glowing crescent shape flew in a large arc A bright white glowing light, that held its shape as it moved.  It was very crescent-like, with the bottom being slightly shorter and sharper.  The closest thing I can describe the shape as is to that of a bottle opener.  It hovered for a second or two, then swooped in a large arc out of sight behind a building.","2010":"Looked exactly like a star but much brighter.  Wasn\u2019t a plane because it stayed in the same spot for about an hour (2am-3am)  Wasn\u2019t a star because it eventually moved.  I looked back a little after 3am and it has moved over a bit.  I couldn\u2019t see it actually move because it was so high up and moving very slowly (comparable to the sun setting).  It eventually moved out of my line of vision and appeared to have disappeared.  I thought it may possibly be a satellite at first but it\u2019s been in the same spot for quite a few weeks now.

Moving at times so fast it made my eyes blur This morning, April 29, 2019, in Caldwell, Idaho, I was sitting outside, waiting for the pugs to take care of business.  It was about 5:15-5:20am.  I looked up in the sky and over to the south, I see 2 moving objects.  I don't mean moving as in flying by.  They were moving back and forth, side to side, up and down.  It looked like they were playing.  I called my husband to come see this.  He watched for a few moments and said he had no idea, but he had never seen anything move like these objects move.  They darted around one would move right then the other, sometimes they would be really close to each other and then one would move to the right so fast it made my eyes blur.  I tried to get video and pictures, but it was so dark they didn't come out very well.  I will say that the short video I tried to get of these 2 moving things did not show them, but showed two small flashing lights hovering all around them.  I did not see these two small lights as I watched the objects move back and forth.  I saw the lights only when I videoed the objects.  The sun was starting to come up by 6am and they were still the the same area, still moving around but staying pretty much together.  I left for work and looked for them in the sky but they were not there.  I would have loved to see how they left.

Ten minutes into gazing and listening to the sounds of peepers in the wetland farm tract to the northwest, is when I noticed two red and white flickering objects out of the corner of my eye coming from my west (Lake Champlain\/Cumberland Head, NY, transiting east.)  I continued to watch these 2 points of red and white flickering objects and determined they couldn\u2019t be small planes because there was no sound and they weren\u2019t moving in a linear way but seemed to be buoyant and bobbing going slightly up and down and then hovering and circling one another as they did this heading slowly east.  I could clearly see the flickering lights even through a slight haze-the distance I would guesstimate to be a mile maybe 2 from my deck.  This continued on for several minutes roughly 15.  The objects were just above the tree line not in the sky and to my eye they would have been near the shoreline by Pearl Bay by East Shore Rd. I have seen these lights once before in the same vicinity during the last month of April but never paid too much notice, just made a mental note of their unusual flickering.  It definitely got my attention last night almost to the point of nearly driving my car the short distance of a mile and a half to (the public beach) on East Shore North to observe more, but didn\u2019t in the end.","2056":"MADAR Node 116","2057":"3 fireballs I saw one bright orangish-red (what we thought to be) a fireball shooting through the sky and then it dimmed out after a few seconds.   Right afterwards I saw two more fireballs, close together.  They lit up the sky the same bright color and then one looked like it exploded, and then smoke emitted as it fizzled out.   The third one seemed to stay lit for a couple of minutes, but I drove off before seeing it fizzle out.   I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before, much less three.

Caught on video Driving home at 3am from work and noticed what it appeared to be a common meteor burning in the atmosphere.  After a few seconds of looking at it, I noticed something was off.  There was many sparks raining from this object similar to fireworks..  I pulled over immediately and tried to get a video on my phone.  The sparks stopped and i was able to see 2 stationary objects where the sparks came from.  One immediately after flew at high rate of speed towards the east.  I am familiar to the speed of military aircraft as i attend many shows, but this object was unbelievable fast.. faster than any f22s i have seen.  No engine sounds emitted from the crafts, it was very quiet night, it would have been obvious if it was plane or helicopter..  Soon after the second craft appeared again  and this time is looked like it had a halo of fire around it.  The craft was in this state of fire for a few seconds and then the fire stopped.  I can see a small light emitted by the cr! aft as it proceeded to make some incredible fast and agile maneuvers before disappearing into the darkness.  I got video proof of the fire event of the second craft as this time i was ready to film as soon as it began.","2059":"Entity seen.","2060":"White orbs with wings. Weather was partly cloudy (thin marine layer over sea, clear over land), wind nw 10kt.  I and a few passersby noticed 4 white dots in the sky.  They had no discernible trajectory but appeared to be moving in a brownian motion (random path) while remaining more or less stationary on a measurable scale.  One was seen through binoculars and the object(s) appeared as a white ball with wings of an indescribable shape.  After some minutes three of the objects disappeared leaving one, which subsequently faded to nothing.  These orbs appeared similar to ones commonly seen launching from offshore (Pacific Ocean) off Pt. Mugu naval sta. seemingly into space at least 5 times faster than rockets launching from Vandenberg, also visible from SB.

At approximately 2 a.m., I quietly went to my balcony to have a cigarette.  I was sitting in complete darkness.   As I sat there, I see a bright object coming out from the darkness coming from around the corner of my balcony.  As the object floats over to the middle of my balcony, I see that it is a 2 foot in diameter teardrop shape that looked like it was full of dense fluid that was brightly lit dark blue with sparkles at the top.  It floated right in front of me about 4 feet away.   My first thought was I just caught a Hersey Kiss drone spying on apartments.  I didnt feel afraid although I felt as though I had caught the glowing teardrop spying on me.  When the object realized I was there in the dark it diminished itself.  The sparkles on the top\/tail consumed the blue dense light and disappeared.  At that moment I knew it wasn't a drone.","2064":"Yellow oval object found on photos.

My two friends saw something strange in the sky while smoking in the back yard.  One of them fetched his high powered video camera and shot a video of it.  The object flashed random light patterns. It changed shape constantly.  It appeared to be purple, but the outline of the object glowed green.  The object moved extremely fast and would change direction on a dime.  It would also change shape just as fast.  It lingered in the same general sky space for quite a long time and it appears to know it is being watched for it seems to be putting on a show of some sort.  Possibly attempting to communicate with the flashing light it emits?  After a while it just disappears into the night.","2066":"We were sitting at the beach and looked up to see a ufo flying over us.  It was circular and had two smaller circular ones that kept changing position around it.  It had no lights, we could only see it because it was reflecting light from the hotel- resort.  It looked almost like a brown color and had a circular pad at the bottom.  It also made no noise at all.  It headed to fly over the ocean and kept going along the shoreline.  We watched it blend into the air, until we could no longer see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

One week later I saw low in the sky a body of lights green red yellow and maybe blue. I saw this craft 6 times after the first time planes started showing up and look like they were pushing it out.  I then saw it go to a higher orbit the most planes I saw at one time was 5 planes.  The last time feb 28th I saw two one high and one low.  I only saw them on clear nights.

Immediately upon stepping onto the back porch, we both looked up to see what we thought was a spotlight, even though where we live made that impossible.  I quickly stated that it must be the moon, while my wife directed my attention to the moon behind me, clearing up that mix up.   As we began to try and get a better look at the lights, a clear shape took form, there were 3 GIANT white orbs in a perfect triangular shape.  When I say GIANT, I truly mean that this craft (if one solid unit) must have been the size of a football field.  I work in an industry that allows me to make fairly accurate scale analysis in a moments notice and my brain simply could not process the shear scale of the craft(s).  I jumped up onto the bench on our back patio to peer over the roof top to see where it was moving and it appeared to be complet! ely silent and heading East towards Geist Reservoir.  Just as my wife joined me standing on the porch bench, it became very clear that this was not of earthly origin....the triangle shaped craft quickly split into three orbs that shot in all different directions, breaking the laws of physics that we live by.  And just like that, it was gone. I have lived with this unsettling event now for 2-1\/2 months and still do not know how to process what I saw.  I steadfastly believe that this planet has been visited by ETs at some point in the history of mankind, but to see something with your own eyes, and know that there are millions others like me....it\u2019s earth shattering.   I decided to share this information in the event it may help connect the dots to a bigger story, or at least preserve this event somewhere that it will not fall on deaf ears.   I pray almost nightly now, having never been a religious man...I pray that whatever that was will come back so I can try to rationalize what I saw.","2069":"My son (13 y\/o) and I were driving home and he pointed out an object in the sky.

Half way to my left, I saw a craft(s) with a hugh bright light in front and the light wrapped around craft like a semi circle.  There were no other lights.   They were 3 of them in line formation, but some distance apart from each other.  They were stopped in midair not moving.  They were hugh in size.

The light was very high in the sky.  Possibly higher than an airplane could go but I am not too sure.  I could not see any FAA lights, wings, or anything, for that matter, other than a very bright light, moving somewhat fast in the sky, for how high up it was.","2074":"UFO over Charlotte-Douglas Airport Sunday 5\/5\/19. I live about 15 minutes from Charlotte Douglas Airport.  I\u2019ve been observing airplanes land from my front porch for several years.  I know what the normal speed of an airplane is.  Very early Sunday, my girlfriend & I were sitting on the front porch.  I had ben watching planes over the horizon, coming in steadily one after another.  A bright light appeared in the same approach pattern as the airplanes.  Its light was much more brilliant than any of the airplanes I have seen.  It took the same approach line, but moving at a pace I would think near Mach I.  I\u2019m not 100% sure that the lights were blinking because there was some low cloud cover, but only in random spots in the sky.  I really believe the light was blinking in what seemed to be a random order.  It followed what appeared to be the exact same landing pattern the airplanes take, then it made an IMMEDIATE turn up at an approximate 60* angle and disappeared immediately afterwords.","2075":"Weird green circular object floating up to the sky.

I had spent the night on the boat and was almost ready to go back to the dock.  I was about \u00bc mile north of the 4 lane launch ramp at the north end of the lake.  At 8:30 am I was drifting with a slight breeze from the north, pushing me toward the dock to the south.  I had a line in the water, fishing, with a large brimmed hat and polarized sunglasses.  The weather was sunny and clear, typical Arizona. I glanced up, looking south, and noticed what I at first thought might be some spiderwebs caught between my fishing rods, which were mounted on either side of the console.  Whatever it was, it was diffuse, and somewhat hard to distinguish, much like the sun looks glinting off spiderwebs.  Its relative size was about that of a full moon, about the size of an aspirin tablet at arm's length.  It was completely stationary.  After a few seconds I thought what I was seeing might be some reflection hitting my sunglasses.  I moved my head up and down, trying to determine where a reflection might be coming from.  At that moment the object moved on a level horizontal path toward the west, out of my visual range, in a fraction of a second.  The acceleration was so great that by the time the object had moved to the right edge of my vision, I could no longer track it.  At that moment I realized what I had witnessed.  There were some people in kayaks, a couple of guys fishing and some other boats to the north and east of my position. The environment was quiet, and I heard absolutely nothing that could be associated with the object \u2013 it was completely silent. I would estimate that it was about 40 degrees in elevation and on a bearing of 180 to 200 degrees. Object size and distance were impossible to determine. The object appeared somewhat like two slightly elongated top hamburger buns, with the bottom bun inverted. There was a slight darker band separating the top and bottom sections. Width to height was about 3 to 1. The overall impression was that of a light weight, white fabric, almost with some translucent quality to it. I did not detect anything unusual looking through my polarized sunglasses.  I am an experienced UFO researcher, yet it was not until the object shot out of sight that I realized what I had seen.","2078":"MADAR Node 100","2079":"3 bright lights flying in triangle formation, would turn translucent. My dad and I were driving as I noticed 3 bright white \u201cthings\u201d flying in a triangle formation.  At first I figured they were planes, but their flight pattern was inconsistent, almost as if they were hovering around or flying like birds.   So then I assumed maybe they were birds.  But I see birds flying around everyday and they just weren\u2019t the same.  They looked too big to be birds, and were SO shiny, and moved to fast to quickly (at speed of planes w\/ flight of birds).   When I first saw them I\u2019d say they may have been 7-10 miles down the road (if looking up) then within the 3 minutes were 20-30 miles away (give or take).  They would all shine extremely bright, but then all at the same time would fade and disappear into an almost translucent state.  Then they would shine again extremely bright, and turn translucent again.  This happened 3-4 times and was consistent.   Their flight pattern was in perfect triangle formation, but at one point they slowed down, almost to a stop and rotated around one another, then kept going back in their perfect triangular shape.   They continued on and disappeared from sight.   My dad also saw them but not for as long as I did.  Though he also had no explanation for it.  We talked about it for a while, trying to come up with what it could have been, and we think either ufo or some sort of government exercise with something we don\u2019t know about.  I\u2019ve seen a lot of birds and a lot of planes, but this just didn\u2019t fit.  It was weird!!  Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t get a video..  I know that\u2019s a big part of legitimacy, but I didn\u2019t want to miss anything for myself.

It was going all over the sky.   We first thought we were seeing things, but we were out there for about 15 mins and it was still flying around.

They just looked like bright lights in the sky, but a bit too far away to make out actual shapes.  They were just hovering and flashing red, green, blue, yellow and white, we watched the lower one about 20 minutes or so, then it just disappeared.   The other was higher up and farther away, but looked the same as the other lower one, flashing different colors.   Then a solid reddish light seemed to come out of that one and flew off pretty fast, then it spread out into what looked like three lights, one solid red and a flashing white and red light. and flew off.

It was a clear night with many stars visible.  We were looking in the direction of Orion\u2019s Belt to the Southwest, when we saw a line formation directly overhead, consisting of 6 lights, traveling from East to West, at a high rate of speed.  From directly overhead to out of sight to the west took about 4 to 5 seconds.  It appeared to be a long thin illuminated light shaft with 6 distinct circular lights evenly spaced along the shaft.  It disappeared into the western sky. This was followed several minutes later by a similar sighting basically following the first one\u2019s path. Then several minutes later there were two more that traversed Southeast to Northwest and then another few minutes passed, when we saw two more traveling North to South. Next, a V formation of lights, 3 or 4 lights on each side of the V, was seen traveling East to West, basically following the path of the first light shaft. ,This was followed by a similar, or the same, V light formation traveling from SE to NW.  Then there was a larger V formation traveling E to W. ,Then a few minutes passed before one larger circular or spherical illuminated object was observed rapidly traveling East to West along the same path as the V formations. ,Several minutes later, another two V-shaped objects, one following the other, were observed traveling NE to SW. ,And then after a few minutes, one more V was observed traveling W to E low in the Southern sky. Shortly after the last sighting, we saw a commercial jet aircraft, traveling N to S, at an estimated altitude of 20,000 feet based on the relative size of its navigation lights.  Based on this, the unidentified formations were above this at around 30,000 feet. Sightings ended at 10:48. I am a former Navy submarine officer and retired engineer.  My fiance'is a retired practical nurse and massage therapist.","2088":"Bright green & yellow lights shooting out from low flying craft at high speed, then followed by tilted line of white lights I experienced this sighting as I travelled home on I62 SW. I was approximately 3 \u00bd mi. south of Washington Court House. I saw a grid of very bright green lights flanked by bright yellow lights.  Green lights were rectangular in formation and yellow irregular.  In front of formation was a small red blinking light which seemed to be what looked like the light of a small air plane.  It appeared to be dragging the other lights along.  Then the colored lights blinked off only to come back a few seconds later.  I watched this out my driver side window as I continued to drive. It was flying slowly and low enough I could do this and try to make sense of what I was seeing.  I then saw that the green and yellow lights were shooting out at very high speed from the red blinking light out front which still appeared to be flying at the speed of a regular airplane.  The colored lights continued intermittently shooting out at rapid speed forming the rectangular formation as before and disappearing as quickly. I knew of a place a mile ahead where I could pull off safely to observe this phenomena, which I did.  The object continued to fly in an easterly direction and was practically out of sight and very low to the horizon.  Yet I saw bright yellow gold lights shoot out 2 more times.  The speed at which these lights shot out looked like fire works with no tracers, no sparking, just bright globes which quickly blinked out.  And then it turned back! With heart pounding, I jumped back into my car and back on the highway.  I was relieved there was other traffic on the road because I could not shake the feeling of being followed.  I was trying to focus on driving and not watching out my driver\u2019s window.  Yet I did look out after travelling about another 4 miles towards home. \u201cOh S**t!\u201d \u2026. Out of my driver\u2019s side window, this time it\u2019s a line of 4 white lights.  They looked like head lights with no space between.  They were not bright and seemed to be flying at a 25 degree angle.  I had another 18 miles to go before getting home and I was tense. I called my brother via cell phone to let him know what I was experiencing, just in case.  My phone record says 8:50 central time so I am guessing first sighting occurred 8:25 CT. I arrive home and still had that feeling so I did not go in the house, but watched the sky instead.  Not 5 minutes passed and what looked like a small aircraft came flying in the direction I was standing.  I saw no shape, only 2 pairs of white lights. No sound, low flying and disappeared.  I have never observed any air craft in that particular position in this location at that altitude in 17 years of living here.  I went inside for 5 minutes only to go out and watch more.  I saw another red blinking light flying low on the south horizon and another on the north horizon 5 minutes after that.  It was a very clear night so it seems strange that the more ordinary lights would disappear.  The lights were too low for cloud cover.  I really strained to hear a droning noise that should have been audible, yet could not hear anything. I am aware that the county I live in is part of the Wright Patt air zone for training.

A few of them seemed to lazily weave between the other lights in a side-to-side manner.  No sound was observed.  The entire event lasted for less than a minute due to light pollution and the speed\/trajectory of the objects.  The other witness attempted to record the event but couldn't find the objects through his phone's camera. It's worth mentioning that this is not the only UFO sighting we have witnessed from this exact same location.  The previous sighting (maybe 3 weeks ago) was only seen clearly by my friend, but occurred in a bright, cloudless afternoon sky.  There was only one object seen. It appeared to change in and out of an 'S' shape, and appeared dark in color.  I will ask him to file a report from his perspective.","2093":"Drone flight video captures unkown circular object, fast approaching, and pulsating appearance. My daughter and I were practicing drone flights in our backyard 2 miles northeast of Stoughton, Wisconsin.  I recorded an HD video of the flight, from the drone, just as practice.  After recording the drone flight that flew to an elevation of about 100 feet, looking West, we reviewed the video and noticed an object entering the video in the upper left corner of the viewing field.  The object faded into view, increasing in size and approaching, circular in shape, but well defined.  The camera's lens had been cleaned prior to flight.  The object remained stationary in the viewing area as well.  It did not follow the motion of the camera which also caused us to believe the object was actually airborne and not on the camera lens.  The object can be seen during 3 diferent time intervals during the short video.  At one point, the object begins to pulse or flash at the drone.  I would have stayed in the air longer had I known I was actually recording an ojbect.  No aircraft ! were in the area at the time the drone was airborne.  We could not see the object visually from where we were standing because the tree line in our backyard was blocking the area where the object was recorded by our drone.","2094":"We went to the sea side early in the morning.

Please analyze and let us know if we have actually witnessed anything unusual?","2095":"Green and white fireball coming toward Earth At the dog park alone, I saw one unidentified fireball\/comet like object.  Its tail was white, and the fireball was neon green.  It was traveling quite fast at a 45 or so degree angle toward the earth.   I did not hear an impact, which surprised me, nor did I hear any noise associated with it.  It was much to large to be a drone.

Went down into the wooded area beyond my sight.  Immediately, 4 totally black helicopters appeared and landed in what looked like the same spot in the wooded area.  Sadly, the landing was totally out of my sight.","2097":"A large bright silver color and shiny fireball moving through the sky from east to west was seen in Cleveland, TN. Early morning 4\/29 while waiting at a traffic light in north Cleveland, Tennessee, I saw a long, bright and silvery object, maybe a fireball in the sky moving from east to west.  I heard no sound so I didn't believe it to be a jet.  It was very large and moving fast.  The entire event lasted only seconds, maybe 10.   When I exited my car, I heard nothing and saw nothing else.  A co-worker of mine also saw the same thing in Hixson, Tennessee, at about the same time.","2098":"flying object, flashing bright light, moving slow north front zip code 32746, dimmer in the deep sky, then shining like morning start","2099":"On 5\/6\/19 in Staunton, VA saw an inverted V shaped craft, with multi-colored lights flickering & dancing over a neighbor's house On the evening of Monday, May 6th, in Staunton, Virginia, at around 10:36 pm, I took my dog outside my house (in the backyard) for his final evening constitutional.  My backyard faces North \/ Northwest, (towards Bridgewater and Harrisonburg, VA) and it was a clear night and I could see the usual evening stars. As I waited, I glanced above the house directly behind mine (about 40 yards away, uphill). Over the roof, I saw what looked like the letter A without the connecting line in the middle hovering above the house.  I looked up the name of this shape and it is called a Chevron (an inverted V).  The shape seemed to be an equilateral triangle with only the right and left sides lit at equal intervals.  The shape was about 1\/6 or 1\/7 the size of the roofline. I could not gauge how far away the actual object was, but know my eyesight would preclude an object that was too far away.  I did not have my glasses on (I am nearsighted).  I just figured it was a plane in the distance because the multi-colored lights twinkled independently of each other. As I stood still and tried to make sense of what I was seeing, I noticed that the actual object was not entirely stationary.  It would move upwards a bit, then hover for about 30 seconds or so, then move a bit to the right, and then hover for about 30 seconds or so.  Then move back to the center and hover, then down to the left and hover.  The movements were smooth, repetitive, and in a subtle pattern.  It reminded me of an intricate dance centered in one area.   After about 2 minutes, I realized that it if the object were a helicopter, I would have been able to hear it.  It was quiet outside, and the object was no smaller or larger than it had been minutes before.  No planes would have still been the same size, or would be hovering.  Goodness! I became more focused on what I what seeing.  I could see the center top and both bottom lights were white and flickering, rather than flashing.   From the bottom (right to left) the lights were subtly various colors: white, blue, red, yellow, white (center top), greenish, yellow, blue, and white (left).  It was if all the lights were really white, but every once in a while, colors were rotated in with the white, at an independent speed from the other lights.   I moved my head back and forth to determine if maybe I was seeing light through tree limbs or branches, and that is why it appeared to dance, but that did not make a difference. The A- Shaped thing was subtly moving, and it made me happy, dancing like that. I realized it wasn\u2019t anything I could explain away. Even though there were tall evergreens and trees nearby, they did not come between the object and me. I ran inside my house (with the dog) to grab my cell phone (charging in the kitchen), and took it back outside to video. I stood there videoing the object for about 2 minutes \u2013 and during that whole time I could see the object with my eyes, but the IPhone which normally takes excellent videos,  showed nothing.  I tried again, and the videos came up black, with me talking and black screen, only. I ran back inside, this time I turned off all exterior lights (garage and porch) the dog came with all three of my cats, this time, and I ran back out to try again.  I spoke as I videoed again, and again, I could see the A object clearly, but the camera didn\u2019t seem to record anything.  The object was still dancing and flickering. I took 3 more videos.  After about 9 minutes of witnessing the object I noted that all lights seemed to be attached (it seemed like one object, not many) as they stayed equidistant the entire time.  The experience was very peaceful and happy.  When I looked down, my 3 cats and 1 dog were all standing or sitting quietly by me. Anyone with cats and a 2 yr.-old dog knows this feline behavior never happens.  I took 5 videos in total, and all the videos have me talking with a blank\/black screen with no images at all. I ran back inside the house, all the animals followed me, and I grabbed my glasses. I left the critters inside and ran back outside in the dark.  This time the object was nowhere to be found.  There was suddenly white cloud cover where the object had been, and a few clouds that seemed luminescent with a slight glow.  I don\u2019t know where the clouds came from?  The rest of the sky was clear. I went back inside for the dog one and took him back outside one final time and he started running in the yard, in circles like a crazy thing (which he can do when he gets excited). This darting around is hard on a leash holder.  I kept looking up but saw nothing else interesting. The dog kept running to and fro in a spastic way, and I suddenly felt a little unnerved.  Why was he crazy like that?  I moved back inside, locked all the doors, and checked on the animals.  They were fine.  I did not go out again.","2100":"Lights circling in the sky. Sitting in our vehicle my girlfriend and I noticed a white light in the sky that seemed to be moving in patterns.  At first we both assumed it was a light coming from the ground pointing upwards into the sky, this was until I noticed a second light that looked to be following the first light around the sky above us.  The second light only stuck around for a few short moments (maybe 10-15 seconds). We posted videos we took of the incident to our snapchat story and immedietley got reactions from friends saying they had either witnessed it themselves, or knew of someone else who witnessed it from the Candy Cane park area, which is about three blocks from where we are sitting.","2101":"Triangular Craft over Vermont In the early morning hours, I woke out of a dead sleep to go to the bathroom.  When I went back to my room something told me to look out the window.  I saw a triangular craft with one beaming light and two other flashing lights.  What caught my attention of it was it\u2019s movement because it was erratic and then it slowed down almost like it saw me watching through the window.   I don\u2019t remember what happened after that, except I lost two hours of time and woke up standing in front of the same window I was observing the craft from.

I sometimes catch a odd feeling to look up. So today I was at work doing my work routine.  my jobs laid back so I'm hanging out. Felt like I should look up towards the sun.  Saw light hanging some ways under the sune.  It appeared to be changing colors.  I kept in mind this could have been a airplane, but it wasn't I'm very used to spotting them.   I live near the main airport here.  And my job has route that fly above and near me.  This orb of light i would call seemed to be using the sun as cover.  I knew it was watching me.  It tried to hide behind a tree once I spotted it.  Like it darted and came to a complete stop.  Its movements were as if you were to move computer mouse and watch the arrow move.  Very swift and precise.   I was running to get my phone playing my music.  I knew I wouldn't make it.  So, I stopped and watched it just fade away.  I have seen this odd orb before.  When I have seen this type it sometimes splits into 3 orbs and takes off.  I don't like to call it a UFO.  It makes me look\/sound crazy.  But this wasn't of earth.  And it's easier to dismiss than to prove fact.   I don't have many I can tell this to that believe me.  So here you go.  Hope someone else saw this.  Just so I help you feel less crazy.  You aren't.  The earth is not what we think.","2103":"Absolutely still object, very large, hovering so close over trees above all street lights, silent, 2 massive bright white lights one on each side parallel, absolutely not a plane or jet of any sort never seen anything like it in my 38 years.

I drove around in circles not a trace in the sky, with a plane ! you can notice it for such along time flying overhead this just literally disappeared, clear night clouds not a reason, was so low clouds wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyways .

Possibly a military test craft. I saw a large aircraft hovering mid air over Freemont, New Hampshire.  It had green and red nav-lights, so it probably is legit and not some \"alien\" craft.  It was larger than any airplanes I've ever seen.  Because it was night time, I couldn't quite make out what the craft was.  The only thing I am sure of is that it is a large, wide, object.  I don't think there is anything to worry about.  It is probably a test aircraft that military produced.  It had nav-lights.  What \"alien\" would put human-made nav-lights on his craft?

Looked in the sky and say a glowing light moving left to right in an almost perfect semi circle.  The speed changed as the craft moved and at times it would almost look like it was just hovering.

At approximately 20:10, I saw a bright orange light appear on the horizon (which is a hilltop from my vantage point) at roughly 270 degrees.  It rose into the sky and proceeded to move northeast. I would guess that it's altitude was at least 1000 feet.  When it reached a bearing of about 30 degrees, another identical light rose, again at about 270 degrees, to approximately the same altitude and moving at about the same speed (as far as I could tell).  I could perceive no noise from the lights; there was traffic moving on the road below me which was fairly noisy, but even when that fell quiet I could not hear any noise from the lights.  The lights remained steady in color and intensity; I could observe no strobes nor navigation lights. The pattern of lights rising at 270 degrees an proceeding northeast continued for about 15 minutes.  As they made their way northeast, their altitude  varied, with the highest no more than 50% higher than the lowest.  At least twice, two lights rose at the same time and separated somewhat as they moved northeast.  My observation was interrupted for about 3 minutes, as I went inside to get my phone at about 20:15.  I didn't have the presence of mind to keep a good count, but I know there were at least 10 lights, but more likely 12. I do have a few minutes of iPhone video, but it is too large to email conventionally - I'll attempt to send it via an iCloud dropbox.","2115":"I saw a non blinking sphere traveling West to East in the Northern twilight.

As I was making my rounds, I saw a bright object fall smoothly to the ground.  It was too smooth to be a flare, or fireworks.  Amazed, I walked over to a trucker and asked if he saw what I have just seen.  He said no, we joked for a minute about UFO\u2019s, and he went on his way. I was still confused, so I returned to the spot where I witnessed the light.  As I was staring in the area, two objects appeared in the sky.  They were off set from each other.  They were maneuvering unlike anything I have ever witnessed on this earth.  At first I thought that they were flying bugs in the distance that were attracted to the street light.  But they were flying smoothly around the area where the light fell.  I was still convinced that my eyes were playing tricks with me, because the objects began to mimic my movement.  They would glide back and forth in sequence.  Then they would maneuver around each other.  When I took steps forward, they ascended, then stopped, when I backed up, they would descend, then stop.  I was convinced it was not my eyes because as I continued to stare, they started gliding again.  This went on for about a good 5 minutes.  Then, I guess they got tired of messing around and disappeared. The objects reminded me of a dragon fly.  They were not saucer shaped, and I did not see any lights coming from them.  I would say drones, but I never saw two drones fly next to each other with that much control, and speed. This report may be nothing, but I will never forget what I saw.

My son and I had just gone for a bike ride around Greenlake in North Seattle because it was a very nice, clear afternoon. When we returned home a little before 6:00 PM, we were laying in the grass in the front yard looking up at the blue sky and noticed an faint object very high in the sky that was moving north to south at a slow speed.  It had the appearance of a white point of light, like a satellite, but it was during the daytime.  It appeared to be too high to be a commercial aircraft and it was moving too slow.  I thought it might be a satellite also because it appeared to almost drift at times, but then I noted it would make sudden bursting movements. After a few minutes, my son noticed another object and it appeared the two objects were approaching each other.  At that time, I called my wife and daughter outside and they could see the two objects as well.  Eventually, the two objects came so close together they seemed to briefly merge.  The two objects then separated and that\u2019s when we saw the third object, but not before I saw a streak of light that resembled a faint meteor, streak near the objects. The three objects then held a tight triangular formation for a few minutes until their luminosity faded to the point where we couldn\u2019t see them anymore.  Afterwards, we all discussed what we saw and we all agreed we saw the same thing.  This sighting was during broad daylight but one would have had to be looking straight up at the sky to see it, and even then you would have had to be focusing fairly intently to see and track the objects.

At approximately 1:30 am on the morning of April 1st, 2019, ((i know the timing is terrible because of the date but i have never been more frightened in my life and this is NOT a joke)) i witnessed what i thought was a meteorite falling in the sky.  i am laying in my bed and i saw the event occurring out of my open window.  i turned to watch the meteorite and almost vomited when i realised it had FROZEN IN MIDAIR.  i watched it float for around a full minute, before it silently separated into several large pieces.  i am unsure if these were all seperate aircraft or not but..  they all just floated there for another half a minute.  in the time it took for my blood to run cold and my mouth to go dry, they LIT UP in the matter of a second, all different colors that actually illuminated my bedroom, and then silently disappeared into nothingness.  i am a firm believer in aliens, and had, until now, never experienced anything like this.","2142":"There was a pulsing and rotating low noise coming from the clouds for over twenty minutes.  The noise did not move from the direction it was coming from and stopped complety afterwards with no fading out.

Drove around the neighboorhood and took a picture of it, but it had moving slowly away from seaworld.","2146":"A white silver object was seen flying and then disappeared I was at my job.  I work at chicopee Wal-Mart.  I work outside as a cart pusher,  I was standing outside, when one of my coworkers spotted a white silver object.  It was flying at a low altitude, so it was easy to watch this object as it moved across the sky.  It was a clear day, so there were almost no clouds in the sky.  As I watched the object, it faded away and disappeared.  This object appeared to be a solid structural craft of some kind.  It didn't change color or leave a trail.  No other objects came out of it.  The object didn't make any noise that I heard.  3 other coworkers reported seeing this object, as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was shing bright blue with a white glow to the back, almost like a propellant or exhaust.  The object was in my view only for a few seconds before it flew off at alarming speeds.  The fastest thing I have ever seen in my lifetime.","2150":"White light with blinking red light and helicopter sound following it Tonight, while walking my dog, I witnessed a white light, like a plane, moving across the sky (west to east) with a blinking red light and helicopter sound following it.  I continued to watch both objects as I thought they were both from XNA.  However, when I saw the red blinking light catch up with the solid white light and it seemed to chase it away, it seemed odd to me.  There was never a plane sound, there were no green and red lights attached to the white light and there was only the sound of a helicopter.  Yet, the white light disappeared in the distance after the blinking red light and helicopter sound caught up with it.","2151":"I always watch the sky while letting my dog out.  Have been doing this for over 6 years. Initially witnessed a single slow low light amber coloured strobe (approx every 15 seconds) at high elevation headed due east then approx. 1 minute later, I obs a very bright clear white flash from high elevation flying over head going due north.  The light dimmed, and approx 30 seconds later, another bright white flash and this pattern repeated as it continued north.

I was travelling North bound (NW) on Old McHenry Rd in Lake Zurich, IL, past Twin Orchard Country Club on my right and then past Heron Creek Forest Preserve.  After I crossed Rt 22 (Half Day Rd) I had noticed some white lights low in the sky on my left above the Kemper Lake in the Golf Course.  As I I realized the lights were not the type one could see on the commercial aircraft I pulled over and watched them approach.  The object was travelling east (SE). The object had a massive \u201cgrill\u201d in front and it emanated red glow in the shape of a horizontal rectangle.  There were two light areas symmetrically placed on both sides of the red \u201cgrill\u201d.  I can\u2019t tell what was the size of the \u201cgrill\u201d, but the total distance between the white lights areas (on opposite sides of the \u201cgrill\u201d) was approx. 120 meters.  The object was emitting very low hum. I had seen strange lights (glowing white points) in the area before (going back to 2017), but had never seen anything this big with the red grill and the sound.","2154":"I saw an echelon formation of five short horizontal white dimmed lights, flying west to east, at constant speed.  The lights didn't maintain perfect formation, but were still tightly close to each other. The velocity seemed fairly high as it took some 15-20 seconds for the formation to fly across the sky, which appeared substantially faster than conventional aircraft.  Nevertheless, in the night sky I couldn't estimate the altitude of the formation, so can't vouch for the velocity estimate either. There was a distant jet engine noise, but I was standing pretty close to the highway, so can't say for sure where the noise came from.

The sun was low on the horizon & the sky above was very dark.  As I looked towards the East I saw a disk that was stationary in the sky with red, blue and green flashing lights, not wavering or making a sound.  I estimate it was 400 ft. above ground.   I watched as long as I had time thinking it was a helicopter but, this looked like nothing like that for it had a reflective surface.  Very unusual experience.","2157":"Strange lights in sky on west side of GF moving east A light was seen on west side of Great Falls heading east.  At first, the light seemed like it could be a shooting star; but quickly it was realized to too slow to be a meteorite and it did not appear to move like a satellite.  The light moved forward for a while before a second light, dimmer and slightly pulsating, appeared behind it.  Both lights did not move in an exact straight line but were not moving all over the place, either.  When recorded on a cell phone, unfortunately the only light that would show up was the first one.  While being recorded, that light appeared to spread out and disperse--much like a calm version of a firework- when on the screen but the light still appeared in the sky while not viewing through the phone's screen.  This might be a technical error with the phone while zooming in, but it happened several times.  The lights disappeared, but I was still aware that whatever was making them was still present in the sky.  I could hear no sounds that seemed out of the ordinary during this time.

To my right, I saw an object traveling at an extremely high rate of speed (50 times faster than any jet in the sky) traveling from my right to my left, West to east.  It looked as if something had entered the earth's atmosphere and was burning.  However, I did not have any depth benchmark and couldn't tell how high it was.  It actually looked like it was going to land at the Sevierville airport.  The object quickly disappeared to my left.  It did not loose altitude.  The rate of speed made me feel the object was close.  I could not distinguish a shape but whatever it was, it was diminished by the large tail of fire behind it.","2179":"Ufo turns on 4 other lights above Vero Beach, Florida.

The object was very bright despite the fact that the sun was up so I decided to get my zoom camera.   While recording a video with my zoom camera, the object turned on several other lights, or other objects appeared in a straight line formation.  I became nervous and the smaller lights disappeared.  I tried to calm down and zoomed in and out a few times and the lights appeared again after I asked it what happened to the lights, did they turn them off.

This was no shooting star I have seen those before.  This was flying across the sky like a plane would but it wasn\u2019t going that fast until we all looked at it, and then it shot off like a bullet across the sky.  We watched it until it went out of our view.  It gave us all goosebumps.  I couldn\u2019t get to my phone fast enough to get a picture or video.  No one will ever believe us and what we saw or they will think we are crazy.  But what we saw was the craziest thing we have ever seen.  I hope it happens again where I can film it.

All we saw was flames coulda been exhaust from a plane, but it was single engine and going fast really fast, faster than all the planes around that we've seen so far that night.

I figured it was a neighbor's house light through the woods. I later got up and checked it out. In the woods you could see a few lights--spread out over a few hundred yards.  The one constant was the light in the middle- it did not disappear as the others would occasionally do. It was hard to determine the size of each light and the distance from me in the dark.  It was also hard to definitively say how many lights, as they went on for a short bit, then after a minute (or few minutes) would disappear.  Then another light, in another position, would light up.  At one time you might see five lights, and then only two lights a minute later.  The lights were predominantly white, but would change to red, and occasionally greenish.  It was hard to detect much motion in the lights, as they were small (almost like looking at a star sized light, in the woods), and just moving your head gave it the appearance it was moving.  But by readjusting your position in the window, you would see more lights that might have been hidden from your line of sight behind a tree. It was not a series of campfires, nor flashlights (my first thought).  Not sure what it was, but it was there for a good two hours before I went to bed. A number of years back, I did report a huge white light on ground level in these same woods.  That light was no more than 100 yards behind my house, in the winter (no foliage to obscure it).  That light was steady, and I alone observed that for a few minutes before getting scared and going to bed to hide from it.","2185":"2 orange spheres that faded away and lasted for about 15 seconds each. There was 2 spheres orange\/ red very small circles that would fade away.  I didn\u2019t get the chance to take a picture or video because I became freighted and terrified.  Although it was beautiful to see another life form come to earth whatever it was, it definitely did scare me.  I know for a fact it was not an airplane or meteor because they would fade away quick.  One appeared as I walking from from the gym at 1:59 am, and the other at 2:01 am, for about 15 seconds each.  I could\u2019 sleep after but the worst part is that before I saw those two circles.

I walk with my friend each morning, so on my way to hers, I saw a huge smoke trail, first going along the sky line, then down my eye followed the trail to then see a jet black huge cigar hurtling towards the ground.  I expected a boom or crash, but nothing after it went out of sight.   I initially thought maybe missile testing, but I would estimate this craft to be at least 5 times the size of a plane.  No lights on it just jet black, although it did seem to pulse a touch, and look darker and more prominent every 2 or 3 seconds.   I then got told to look at the Daily Mirror online as something similar had been seen in Alaska.  I looked and it wasn't just similar, that is, an exact replica of what I saw, and the smoke trail identical.","2187":"i was walking and i saw a saucer it was to fast to be a Airplane.

I wasn\u2019t expecting to see that and it startled me.  It was pretty close to me, I would say approximately 100 yards away.  At that distance, it looked like the size of my street light.   The color was what really freaked me out.  It was purple and pinkish in color, and it also seemed to emit some kind of clear light.   I watched it for about 15 seconds.  It moved really slow in my direction then, all of the sudden it just disappeared.  No streak in the sky, no going behind a cloud, nothing.   At first, I tried to rationalize it by thinking it may be my neighbor who flies drones, but it really didn\u2019t look like one and the way it disappeared leads me to think it wasn\u2019t that.

It had two blinking red lights and had drone like hovering.  It continued to go back and forth (east and west) and would sometimes dip below the tree line and disappear.  It did this for about 10 minutes and then took off flying northeast, at which time, we saw a small green light turn on.  It flew pretty closely past our house and no sound was heard.  We moved to the north side of the house and watched it fly out of sight and it disappeared.  If it was a drone it had a really long range it was operating in.","2200":"((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no detailed information about alleged sighting.

We have large, vaulted, triangular windows.  A light out one window caught my eye. Very far up, above cruising altitude for a plane, was an orange light.  It flickered continuously and floated in the sky like you would picture a ping pong ball floating on water.  It went up a little and down a little but stayed in the same general area.  I stood frozen for approximately three minutes and it continued floating and flickering.  It looked very much like a giant ember from a fire floating up into the sky. I finally texted my husband.  He rushed out without his glasses and saw the light.  He went outside onto the porch.  With his eyes being blurry he said the object looked triangular.   He raced in to get his glasses, and I continued to watch the light flicker and float.  He put his glasses on and the light became fainter each time it flickered.  After about the third flicker the light disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It was approximately 7 PM when my attention was drawn to the south, towards a green light.  The light, which appeared point size at first, and then more oblong, sped northbound, almost as if it were following the highway. Several minutes later there was a sound like thunder, a low rumble.  Again, my attention was drawn toward the southern horizon.  Only, it wasn\u2019t thunder. Instead, four huge helicopters appeared to come in low off the beach and proceeded to fly inland at high speed.  They flew from south to north, staggered one across from each other, and followed the same route as the green light had travelled. The helicopters were dark in color, not exactly black, but more of a glossy navy blue, and each bristled with refueling booms and radar domes.  They appeared to be unmarked, and as they past east of me, in the vicinity of the highway, the beat of the rotor wash was enough so that I could feel it against my chest.

I ran inside to have my girlfriend take a look to make sure I wasn't crazy.  She saw the light I was looking at and we both watched it slowly dim to a smaller light and disappear.  It did not vanish behind a cloud instantly.","2205":"I was at a friend's house in northwest portion of Town.  We were watching a movie outside in the backyard.

It was moving towards the southeast.  As it continued on its path it slowly disappeared as if it turned off the lights.  When I looked at my friend she had noticed it also!  She\u2019s a flight attendant and for me I\u2019m a student pilot, we noticed that it didn\u2019t look like a plane or a drone. we\u2019re not sure if it was a meteor, if it was it was the slowest one I\u2019ve ever seen and it didn\u2019t leave a trail like a shooting star.

I said you can\u2019t do that!   I called my granddaughter to come look.  It went behind a tree with no leaves, so it was still visible.  I thought to show it to my granddaughter as it came from behind the tree but it disappeared as if swallowed or it turned off its lights or something.

It was so unusual that I just kept staring at it.   To my surprise it began to move slowly across the sky in a southeasterly direction.

As I was closing my door, I happened to look West in the sky and noticed what at first I thought was a meteor because of how bright orange the light was.  But I then noticed that there was not a tail of light or smoke at all.  The sky for the most part was clear with a few high thin clouds nothing really to block my view.   The light was traveling at some what of a slow pace, slow enough for me to pull my phone out of my pocket and contemplate filming the light.  But I ended up keeping my eye on it.  It flew from West to East in a straight line.  As it flew over my head, I tried to listen to see if it made a noise like some type of aircraft, but it was completely silent.  As it flew over my head the fireball started to dim, until it went completely black.  The strange thing was as the orange light disappeared I could see a fuzzy grey silhouette of what used to be glowing orange still heading east at! the same speed with no sound what so ever.  I know a plane tends to have white, green or red lights flashing but this was silent and bright orange and faded to a fuzzy grey.","2234":"8 Red\/Orange spheres flying slow and very low at night.

PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello Peter See below original summary, but I thought about something today that is interesting Last night, the reason we saw this object in the first place, is because we were focused on an area of the sky, that had a flickering light, I had just told my wife, that is a satellite, not a star, because of the evident flicker, those are the solar panels\u2026.  We were using an app on my android phone called \u201cSkyview\u201d \u2013 this app shows all object in the sky including satellites, spent rockets etc\u2026   The flickering light was stationary and Bright.  The Phone app did not recognize it, I tried to load update to the app, to see if it would then identify. Then, we saw the fast moving object, directly from same general location.  I stopped thinking about the flickering object, and am not certain if it remained\u2026  I believe it did.  So I do not think the fast object was the original Flickering object\u2026 but small chance it was the same.  I am just not certain now, as I did not connect the 2 objects last night\u2026 only today did I think about the location and the possibility that they were in some way connected. Also, you said last night that there was a similar report from Arkansas, and also something reported West of Spokane.  I used Google Earth, and made a Pin Drop out West of Tampa over the Gulf.  Another West of Spokane, and noted that the line traverses directly over Arkansas.  (See attached) Let me know if you have any questions Also \u2013 What were the times the Arkansas and Spokane reported?  I believe mine was very close to 2300 EST ((END ADDENDUM))","2237":"An object too low to be a satellite, too fast and quiet to be an airplane, with a red light. I live with my mother, and she was preparing a birthday cake Friday night for my niece, who had a birthday party on Saturday.  We bagged up some kitchen garbage and I hauled it out to the dumpster behind our apartment late that night (approx. 11:45pm -- we're night owls). I happened to look up as an object flew in to my view from the west.  It crossed the sky in about four seconds, moving at incredible speed, faster than any airplane or jet I'd ever seen. It was close enough that I could vaguely make out the shape of something, but it was too dark and moving too quickly to make out definitive detail.  The only real piece of identification I could see was a single red light on the bottom of the object--it did not pulse, it did not blink, it was just a solid red light. It was too close to be a satellite, as it definitely had some kind of silhouette (but, again, too dark to tell what).  And it definitely was not a jet, drone or airplane, given this object did not make any sound.  It could have been some kind of glider, but it seemed to be moving way too fast for that to be a possibility. It traveled from the west (in the direction of Lake Tahoe), to the east (veering north-ish). About ten minutes later (11:58pm-ish), after I made my way back up to the apartment and told my Mom what I had seen, I had begun making a late night meal of a tuna sandwich.  As I began assembling the sandwich, the apartment was buzzed by a very low flying jet flying moving very quickly.  I did not see the jet, and I do not know which direction it was traveling, I just heard it roar over the top of the apartment.  It sounded like a rumbling gust of wind at first, but I heard it trail off in to the distance.  It probably rattled the windows it was flying so low and so fast. My 72 year old mother was in the bathroom at that time, on top of being hard of hearing, and did not hear this jet over the sound of the ventilation fan in the bathroom. A few minutes after that (12:02am-ish), another jet (or possibly the same jet) could be heard in the distance, though it did not approach the apartment anywhere near as closely.  My mother was present and did hear this. About an hour or two later, we had to run to the store to buy shredded coconut for the cake (as my Mom had forgotten to buy some earlier that day).  It was designated that I had to run in to the local Wal-mart to buy the coconut, as my Mom's hair was in curlers and she was too embarrassed to enter the store herself.  As I left the apartment parking lot, over the hills to the west again, I could have sworn I saw a dot of light shoot in to the sky at very high speed, like a meteor going straight up, but I am not sure if that was my eyes just laying tricks on me due to the excitement of seeing the other object earlier in the night.  It was very faint against the night sky. After going to sleep later that night (4-5am), I slept in to around noon the next day, and was awoken by a very similar jet flying over the apartment again, low enough that I physically felt my bed vibrate as it passed. I've maybe had five alcoholic drinks total in my 35 years on this earth, and three of those were at weddings I attended in 2015.  I haven't tasted alcohol at all in nearly two years.  I have never, ever done recreational drugs. This is the first time I've ever seen anything like this.  When I saw the objects in the sky, I was of sound mind and body, fully aware of my surroundings, and wide awake.","2238":"Red\/orange, glowing, triangular-shaped object with orbish glow hovering low in the sky.

Then rose steadily upwards moving west south west and disappeared high into the night sky.","2239":"Initially I thought I was witnessing a fast-moving shooting-star, until it did an abrupt 180 degree turn.

Then the battery hand on the dash drew down and the lights dimmed and the car drove slower as if it was losing power.  Then there was a bright flash in the sky and the car drove normal again.   We called 911 and they connected me to the ky state police but they just said it was due to storms and dismissed any paranormal activity.","2244":"On the night of April 13th or very early April 14th at about 2 am some unexplainable events began to unfold. First, my wife woke me up because while out on a drive she noticed a bright light in the sky, similar to a star, but slightly brighter...this thing was moving back and forth, up and down, a figure 8, just erratic.  Not super fast usually, fairly subtle mostly to the point thay when I first looked I didn't notice. So, I blow it off and start talking and looked away and she insists I look again.  When I looked back it truly WAS moving erratically!  I could not think of any possible thing that would move like that.  As I stare in awe I begin to adjust my eyes and notice at least 6 other lights but these ones were slighter dimmer than the stars.  They were darting back and forth it seemed!  I pulled my phone out hoping I could use the zoom to see better what was going on.  My phone camera wouldn't pick up the stars or the dimmer lights I mentioned but clear as day you can see the larger light in the sky on the camera.  I have video.  Through the phone camera zoomed at 8x(max) it looked like it was spinning, like looking through glass, and pulsed every once in awhile which in the video seemed to make it disappear for a couple seconds every 15 seconds or so. It stayed in the sky for hours drifting slightly to a different spot of the sky over time and continually moving in unexplainable ways. If I had only seen this, as weird as it was, I would not report it.  However, while this was happening and we're staring at the sky at about a 45\u00b0 angle, we witnessed something completely unexplainable and in my mind worth reporting. The sky seemed to have gotten darker out of nowhere...we both felt \"weird\" and hard to explain but it felt like a void, and a temporary breathlessness.  I had the urge to look up because it looked like something was going to fall on us. It appeared of nowhere and I almost wanted to move out of the way.  Then it just floated there for a second like a blimp flying.  It looked like 5 engines or cylinders all attached and white or silver in the shape of a V.  It didn't make a sound and was either car sized or jet sized. It was hard to tell how far up it was because it was so fast and scary.  It honestly was more like an absence of sound and then it took off at unprecedented speed after gliding or hovering for 5 seconds or so. Our best guess as crazy as I know it sounds...is that a portal opened up and a ship came through.  I had chills.  I would have never heard it if I hadn't seen it and wouldn't have been looking without seeing the star looking ufo's so I feel like it must be connected but idk.  I just don't want to feel like i'm crazy so I need to report it.  My wife saw all the same stuff and felt the same way at the moment that this ufo appeared.  We wont ever forget what we witnessed.","2245":"I was at a flea market and happened to just look up and there was a bright object that was just floating in one spot and it tend to get brighter and bigger in shape and then disappeared then appeared again.

In this latitude (Costa Rica) these days, the sun is hidden at 1745 hours, there were about 15 minutes of direct sunlight when you observe the phenomenon, also, as we are affected by the phenomenon of \"La Ni\u00f1a\" there was a lot of cloudiness. The bad part was that I had my camera in my hand and had the tripod next to me, I could not use it, if I moved I lost the opportunity to capture the object. This is the video, what I just uploaded to YouTube for sr so heavy and make two more:","2248":"Hovering red and white lights at very high altitude, probably 60,000 feet Very high up probably around 50-60,000 feet, I and my wife saw a moving and then stationary flash white and red right hovering.  It was not a plane because we saw other planes fly by it as it stopped to hover in one place.","2249":"Traveling from south to north from far away i thought was a large bird as it got closer i realized i didnt know what it was.  It was triangle in shape seemed to have a field around it it was tumbling instead of flying strangest thing ever seen.","2250":"I went outside to smoke a cigarette and looked up into the sky, at first I thought I saw a plane but then the light went from barely moving, to shooting across the sky and disappearing.   I debated on whether or not my eyes were playing tricks on me and maybe it was a shooting star or meteor, but it seemed to be awfully close to be something like that.  It looked as though it was near the clouds.  Not to mention the way it went from barely moving like a plane to shooting off across the sky?

The sighting lasted about four seconds and then it vanished from our sight.  It was a clear night with no planes or helicopters in the area.  It didnt not make any noise, it was only one that we saw.  Our dog started to whine at the time, which I have no idea if one t hing had to do with another but as soon as it vanished our dog settled down a few minuutes later .","2252":"green fireball falling from sky While driving with my sister, heading north, we witnessed a ball of greenish white light hovering in the sky, far brighter and larger then an average star.   It then began to plummet eastward, starting on fire and leaving a tail of flames behind it in the sky.  We lost sight of it once it hit the tree line.","2253":"Bright orange flying objects in sky I was sitting in bed and heard a high pitched swirling noise.  I thought it could've been some aircraft landing in the field next to me.  I looked out the window and seen 2 bright orange glowing cross shaped flying objects best way I can describe the movements is dancing with each other cross crossing sort of.  I froze for a second and woke my boyfriend up and told him to look he did and said yup that's is very weird, I asked him what he thought it could be, but he said he had not a clue.  I ran out the room to my kids' room as they flew away really quickly and didn't see them again.  On a side note my cat meowed and laid next to my side before this happened and he does not do this  when I am going to bed he lays by my feet all the time.","2254":"Bright wht light, like a camera flash, every 2 sec on driver side of truck for 20 min, into field, returned, to back of truck, faded be Just outside of Jackpot, Nevada, 2:15 a.m., so dark, heading north on highway 93 toward Twin Falls, Idaho. An extremely bright white light followed the drivers side of my truck for almost 20 minutes.  Every 2 seconds the light would flash on, like a camera flash, then off again, then 2 seconds later flash again. Like a strobe light.  When I sped up, it sped up - to 70 mph.  When I slowed it slowed.  It went off into the adjacent field and then came back again and continued to follow.  Eventually it was right behind the truck canopy and followed for several minutes before it faded into the distance behind me and I could no longer see it.","2255":"Arrow like figure shot across the sky Was standing on my backyard deck and saw a arrow like formation of orange lights fly across the sky.

It was white, but very dim, almost looked like a cloud out of the corner of my eye, but as it passed over, I could make out shape.  It was moving to fast to get a decent look at details, the thing that really got me was the lack of sound.  It was completely silent.  I have been around air planes all my life and seeing something move that fast, i was expecting some kind of engine noise.  I verified that the wind was blowing south at 2 mph and this was heading north at an incredible speed.  Hope this explains a little better and please let me know if you have any follow up questions!

It was reflecting the morning sun on this fairly clear morning.  Blue sky with light clouds.  No wind.  About 66-68 degrees and sunny.  I ran in and got my binoculars and camera.  It moved very slowly across the sky from NE to SE for about 25 minutes.  At times it disappeared behind the high clouds and then reappeared.  It reflected the sun's light the entire time.  I took 59 photos of the \"dot\" in the sky.  When magnified the object was as follows: bright silver cylinder with a donut shaped object attached on top of one end of the cylinder.  My various photos showed different views of the object, so indeed it was turning around both horizontally and vertically.  My wife and neighbor both witnessed this sighting.  I verified with the local military air installation that they did not see that object even though it appeared to be above MCAS Miramar at one point.","2258":"My friend and I were driving home and all the sudden out of the clouds a huge large silver sphere was falling from east to west.  Large blinking LED lights.  We didn't capture a video because it all happened so fast.  It was so big for miles away we saw it.  We don't know what it was. It was silent. And a friend following five minutes behind us driving saw colors of green, white and red.  A completely different one.  Something is going on!  Before this all happened, there were large carp fish spreaded all around our property and we are nowhere near a lake.  These fish are probably 15-20 pounds, and 30 of them.  Our dog was also acting very strangely to us and growling.  This was this morning.","2259":"Took some pictures of a sunset over the Olympics and caught some interesting artifacts not visible to the eye.","2260":"Chevron shape objects at night While out in our hot tub, my wife and I were stargazing, when we saw a Chevron-shaped craft with dim lights on the bottom of the wings 4 on each side and 2 at the front of Chevron.  It was moving from west to east and was completely silent and was visible for 5-7 seconds and then disappeared into the night.  I reported the same sighting on this website in early November of 2015 also.  The craft was for real!  We scanned the sky for the next 15 minutes and also saw another Chevron shaped object that was white heading south to north and this one did not have any lights on the bottom of the wings.","2261":"I saw a bright light hovering outside my window and it moved in a way I\u2019ve never seen before.

I could see it was in front and lower the mountain ridge.  As I got closer I lost sight because of some trees.  When I did see it again it was moving a rapid pace flying north toward Cedar City.

I thought, helicopter, ultralight or balloon?  But it stopped and was motionless.  I pulled my phone out to zoom and take a photo but the object disappeared?

One light shining more from the left, and the other shining more from the right.  It looked as if it had 2 decks, a lower and an upper. It was located near the moon, but not too close to it. Every now and again, it would raise up, and nobody could see it.  After about 30 seconds, it would lower back down, and become more visible. As we were driving, a car was on the side of the road, he had no flat tires, not out of fuel, the hood was up and the engine was fine.  It had just stopped working, abd from the looks of it, due to magnetic\/electric effects from the object.

On the evening of April 16, 2019, at approximately 9:30pm CST, I was driving my van south on Knox Station Rd in rural Knoxville, IL, when I noticed what I originally thought were fireworks in the sky.  These lights appeared to be very high in the sky, possibly \u00bd mile in altitude.  I asked my husband his opinion of what they were.  Both of my children, 15 and 11 were also in the vehicle.  We pulled over on the side of the road, where both of my children exited the vehicle to begin recording the strange phenomenon.  My husband also began recording the lights in the sky from inside the vehicle.  There were two large orange lights that would leap in equal intervals from one and other.  Each would leave a tail of smaller orange dots and then disappear for approximately \u00bd of a second before reappearing and leaping west again.  The lights would make a rapid movement and then stop.  At one point both of the larger lights collided and went dark.  Again within a split second the! lights reappeared with the tails of smaller lights and began moving westward again.  As we proceeded South on Knox Station Road, the lights never appeared to become closer.  They were very bright and were very apparent in the night sky even with a cell phone tower below them and a \u00be moon.  At approximately 9:38 pm CST, the lights vanished from the sky.","2274":"A light would appear, following by one or more lights slightly in front of it which sometimes looked like fireworks or some kind of explosion, and the first light would disappear.

The object, which was triangular in shape, specifically scaline, with the longest edge facing the sky, was illuminated with a green light, and it appeared the whole craft was lit, rather than having any artificial lighting.

I had seen this same thing about 10 years ago while I was walking on the beach at night with my mom.  Same place.","2292":"Three lights in the shape of a triangle with one red light in the center. On Wednesday, April 17th, 2019, at approximately 20:20 hrs., I took my dogs out to the back yard as I normally do every day around this time.  My rear door faces South, so when I walk outside, I\u2019m looking almost due South.  It was mostly cloudy with high thin clouds and I could see the brightest stars in the sky intermittently through the clouds.  My attention was drawn almost directly above, to a silent, triangle shaped object that was heading South at a rather slow rate of speed compared to the everyday air traffic in the area.   Another interesting comparison to the everyday local air traffic is it goes East to West or West to East and very rarely have I ever seen it travel North to South.  The only things that appear to deviate from that pattern are helicopters, hot air balloons or powered parachutes and none of these can be mistaken for what I saw. I watched in disbelief as I attempted to explain it away in my mind, but I couldn\u2019t.  There were three white or dull white lights, each marked a corner of the triangle and it had one slowly, pulsating red light in the center.  I was able to see an outline of the triangle since the moon had the clouds somewhat glowing.  I didn\u2019t have my phone with me when I reached for it to snap a picture and I could feel my heart pounding harder with each second that I watched, knowing that no one would believe me.  I thought I saw a green light near the front of the triangle which, appeared to be circling in a sporadic manner of directions.  The green light looked like just a light that I couldn\u2019t determine an outline for, much smaller and much less intense compared to the triangle.  This all happened in probably less than a minute, but I couldn\u2019t leave my dogs out, so I called inside to my wife, but she didn\u2019t hear me over the TV. I slept on this before typing this because I still can not believe what I saw.","2293":"Bright stationary object with light that started to blink very low to the ground and very close by My mother had claimed to see a bright, blinking object several nights in a row at the same time outside the back windows of her apartment (to the west\/sw).  I figured it was a star or a plane, because there is an airport nearby and bright blinking stars and planes head in that direction (west) constantly.  Tonight (4\/17\/19) I kept an eye out, and before bed (10:30pm), I looked out and to the southwest I saw a very bright light, VERY low to the ground, definitely wasn't a helicopter (we have them all the time and they are loud), would have maybe been over McGalliard Road or close to it, hard to judge, but definitely CLOSE.  It looked stationary and like it was turning and the light (like a spot light) started to blink.  I hurried away to get my mom, literally not 2 minutes, and it was gone.  My mom has claimed that when she sees it, she feels it knows she is watching, then it zips off like a flash.  I never saw it leave.  It was just gone after I got here and went to the window.  I am generally a skeptical believer, but I have been looking out here for 22 years at this location (just observing the night sky, not looking for UFOs), and this wasn't something normal.  I, too, felt like it knew I saw it, although I can't say why I felt that way.  It looked like a large object (details indistinguishable because the light was turning in my direction and blinding) with a very bright light attached to it that started to blink brightly as the object turned to my direction.  lol  NOT NORMAL AT ALL.  Oddly enough, I saw something very similar nearby in the country about twenty years ago.  I'm going to watch for it again the next few nights since it seems to be returning.  I immediately went to google to see if there have been in any sightings recently here, and found this website and decided to leave this report. I'll report again if I see it again.  Honestly, I don't see how no one else saw it, considering how low and bright and big it looked (not huge, but bigger than a star\/plane\/or helicopter).  There was no sound whatsoever.  I thought my mom was crazy, but now I am wondering myself. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

At 9 a.m. this morning, I heard a rumbling sound that I thought was thunder and it got progressively louder. I then realized that it was not funder but some sort of aircraft traveling in an east-to-west direction. As it got louder and over my location I realized that this was much louder and lower in frequency than the normal jet. I have heard many different Jets even in full afterburner and this was much louder and lower and frequency and sounded more like a very large rocket exhibiting the typical low-frequency pops that are heard with large rockets. the total time that I heard this event was probably 5 to 6 minutes before the sound finally dissipated to the West. the sky was totally overcast so I was not able to visually see what the object was.","2295":"Swarm of 6-8 lights, stationary for 5-6 minutes, then receded slowly into the distance.

They were above and parallel to the water. The lights were a short distance apart.  As I watched I saw a red beam come from between the two lights and down to the beach in front of my house.

I remember being frightened; however, could not break my gaze. Then it disappeared. The encounter was a matter of seconds, approxx. 10-20 seconds. This past week, I have been trying to understand what I saw and recount the details.  It has been haunting.  For a few  nights, I was afraid to go to sleep.

It wasn\u2019t until I heard on the news, there were strange parallel lines in the sky above Los Angeles, the next day, April 6, that I believed it could have been an entity encounter. To clarify my personality,  I am a 63 year young woman , married for 34 years , no children , just my beautiful dogs.  I am of sound mind, very grounded always level headed. I do not participate in any groups or clubs  We live on a hill top in Salinas surrounded by 8 acres, I cannot disclose our address due to my husband\u2019s company, which deals in secure information from ((subject deleted)). I am a ((deleted for the past ((three decades)) years in Carmel, CA. I wanted to share this experience with you as it still haunts me and remains prominent on my mind.

First a bright flash caught my eye, then as i look over i see the beam & another (light?) with a cylinder shaped green aura around it which appeared to be slowing down as it got closer to the ground, but it all happened fast.  Data recieving?  The cylinder shape light that appeared to be traveling down the beam is what threw me off.","2309":"MADAR Node 122","2310":"Unidentified flying object on tracked night sky images On the night of April 9, I was out doing some Milky Way imaging with my skytracker that compensates for the earths rotation therefore keeping stars and planets still in images.  The next day while reviewing my images  I saw an image that has an unidentified flying object in the frame.  I have no logical explanation for what it could be. My mirror was locked on my camera and I was no where near my tripod to have hit the tripod to create such an effect. I was hiding from the wind in another location and did not witness this with my eyes. Images were taken At the big red lighthouse in Holland MI.  The artifact is on my image at 0430.","2311":"Two oval-shaped stationary orbs brightly reflecting light The objects appeared to be one exceptionally bright light.  It was not moving and was actually two oval-shaped lights\/objects side by side when viewed through binoculars.  The lights dimmed as the sun set, but also glowed red, then faded.   The observers where 2 adults and 4 children. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The ISS was 28 degrees above the Horizon moving WNW to S at 50 degrees above the horizon.   As I was setting up, I notice two transparent object moving NW to W at a high rate of speed and seem to be in tight formation and almost looked as they where trying to pass on another.  They made no sound, had two lights, and moved way to fast to be any type of aircraft.  Before I could get my camera turned around they where gone may be last 5 seconds or so before they where out of site.   Judging from my position which was anywhere between 50-100 feet they looked to be between 20-30 degrees above the horizon.","2314":"bright light vanishes like nothing at a fast speed I was playing soccer with my sister.  It was getting dark so we decided to start heading home.  But first i had to change my shoes.  I sit down at a bench & i look up at the sky.  As im looking I see a bright light.  I didnt think much of it, like \u201coh its just a star\u201d.  Then it flashed & it literally like zoomed so fast & just vanished.  Completely disappeared out of no where.  As it was about to disappear, the speed was just fast.","2315":"Triangular craft witnessed in fort Walton beach I simply stepped outside to walk to the park off of Holmes blvd and jonquil near Santa Rosa mall and just happened to look up and could clearly see a defined slim triangle with six round dimly orange glowing lights also in the shape of a triangle, flying low, id saying 100-150 ft above the tree line, it was moving very slowly and quietly,  I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes and watched it continue on its path (towards Navarre\/ gulf breeze\/ hurlburt AFB) for as long as I could before it disappeared over the tree line.  Like I said it was dark, just passed 9:00 probably about 9:20 or so but the craft was so low I could distinguish its triangular shape unmistakenly.  I spent the next hour in the park starring up at the sky, in shock, and when I finally got home and tried to go about my normal business I discovered the internet was down in the neighborhood as well.","2316":"UFO caught with binoculars by 3 people. 1 craft seen with binoculars, way brighter than all the stars, had lights all around the disk which looked like maybe 6 inches apart, kept hovering for 10+ mins at a time before moving around the sky just a little bit at a time.  There were 6 helicopters in the 30 mins I was out there that kept flying in its direction and that is very unusual.  It was still out there when I went outside but it was a legitimate UFO that I could see with binoculars before it got too far away.","2317":"Two, silent v-shaped craft with underside lights moving swiftly in unison heading southwest over Linwood, NJ. Last night, I was visiting my cousin and her husband.  We were outside enjoying the evening in their yard and having a conversation.  I was looking up at the sky in the direction of Orion's Belt (SW).  Directly in my field of vision, from behind me, the crafts passed overhead.  There were two large, v-shaped craft which had multiple, uniform dim white lights.  They were moving quite swiftly and made zero noise.   My mind attempted to dismiss it as a flock of white geese or an airplane, but clearly it was neither.  I have never seen anything like it before.","2318":"A very bright very large object in sky by Plainville airport that hovered in the sky and quickly disappeared I was driving by Plainville airport and looked up at the sky it had been cloudy and rainy to see a very bright circle object in the sky it hovered around it kinda reminded me of a crease to shaped moon but was much bigger and very much brighter as I watched trying to piece together what I was seeing so brightly in the sky  it quickly flew away it from giant to a dot far away to poof it was gone it took me the next 15 minutes of my ride home to realize what I saw","2319":"Spinning rainbow colored lights Two space craft like circles, spinning.  Both have rainbow lights going in a circle, over and over. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

I was standing at my back porch to smoke a late night cigarette, when a stream of light appeared out of no where int the sky.  It was far too low to be a shooting star, but that is the best way I can describe what I saw.  However, what was strange about this was rather than fade out, like most shooting stars I've seen, this ended with a bright burst of light, like a bright flash, and then vanished. the streamed of light from the \"burst\" were mainly horizontal ...  The rays were distinct in direction rather than dispersed.  The light was a very pale blue color.","2321":"I was very scared and now I'm concerned. It was between midnight and 1 am, this morning, Thursday, April 11, 2019.  I was in the jacuzzi at a mineral springs spa in Desert Hot Springs, California.  I noticed a very bright light bigger than the stars and it almost seemed to have 2 lights very close or maybe it was  just blurred because it was very bright. My heart started to beat very fast when I thought I saw it had been coming closer.  I wasn't imagining things..  it was coming closer.  It didn't come close enough that I could see any clearer of what this was, hoping it was a drone.  I was petrified and grabbed my robe and ran to my door.  I waited about 20 minutes and went outside and it was back in the original area I first noticed it. I finally fell asleep and waited for the day to end so I could look in that spot and hopefully see the same light.  It would be a star and I could relax.  It was gone.  It's no longer there. I've looked online, but I haven't seen any one else report it.","2322":"3 triangular lights appear while driving North bound from Chular, CA. Driving North bound from Chular.  3 triangular lights appear from my left side crossing freeway 101 to my right side.   At first I thought it was an irrigation plane, but the lights made a triangle, the lights were facing down and not straight.  I lowered my window to hear the engine, no engine noise.   The Triangular object faded away once on my right side, leaving two streaks of smoke\/gas not sure.","2323":"was on porch  very low  bright  flew past fast from SE  to  NW  all dogs withi n blocks went crazy as did mine  anyone else see.

It was as low down as a plane can fly and just very bright, but didn't seem very big at all.  It kept a straight patt S\/E.   I've seen these before on different occasions that are pretty low and theu make no noise.","2325":"Just get to the office, looking something like a boomerang in the sky, moving east to west, shining light and get black and so on, my boss see me looking the sky, I show him, then I saw for few second another object similar going up closer to the other one and then go down moving west faster and I lost it.  My boss was able to see it for a minute or two. Morning March 29  I saw a similar object .","2326":"stationary, bright white round light in the daytime sky, brighter than the moon, larger than any star or plant, over Apache Junction, AZ. I observed a bright white light, motionless in the sky, 6pm in the afternoon, the sky was still blue, the moon was out there was no stars or planets visible, the object was brighter than the moon.  The day was windy, 20 mph steady winds, clouds were moving, the object remained stationary for over 20 minutes.  I returned 1\/2 hour later to see if it was still there, the sky was now dark and the object was no longer visible.","2327":"Bright light in the sky in Mesa area Around 7:00pm we saw this bright light in the sky that looked like a miniature sun.  The light shape and color changed several times.  Also the movements were not consistence with known flying objects.  The sighting lasted about 25 minutes.  The shape got smaller and then looked like a star.  I have videos and pictures that proof what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

No flashing lights to indicate that it was an airplane.  I watched it thinking it might be a satellite, but it moved too quickly.  I tried to videotape it, but could not center it. I have a photo.  The orb continued south at a high rate, then slowed down and the lights went out.  There was no sound.","2329":"I was walking my dogs outside in south Austin around 9:20pm.  I caught something in the corner of my eye and was able to identify a triangular object moving across the sky.  The moon was bright as well as the stars and I saw a triangle with lights on it gliding across the sky.  It was very faint and almost blended in with the sky, but I have excellent vision and could comprehend what I saw.  A triangle shape that had lights along the sides of it. It was moving fast, faint light, and was definitely something out of the ordinary.  I live by a large airport and there are multiple military and airports within the area.  Thank you for collecting this information, as I saw multiple reports of the same thing on this site with Austin, Texas, and it validates what I saw.","2330":"3 large orange balls of light in the western sky at 10pm. 3 large balls of orange light in western sky.  Stationary, in straight line.  Looked like glowing orange balls, very close together.  Extremely bright...lit up the surrounding area and slowly dimmed.  Neighbors have seen similar balls of light over the last few nights between 9pm and 10pm.","2331":"2 Large triangle shape flying objects directly over my house that were loud upon approach but quiet underneath and behind flying slow. I was sitting in my house folding clothes and heard a loud noise and I thought something was about to crash in my back yard.  A plane, a rocket or an asteroid.  I was scared it was that loud and close.  Then I heard it pass by the back of my house so I walked out in the yard and looked up and there were 2 triangle shapes so low to the ground I thought I could throw a baseball and hit them.  They had a yellow light on either end and a red light in the middle of the back.  I expected it to be so loud because of what I heard coming towards me.  But looking up under it there was barely any sound.  It was also traveling slower than anything I have seen that large travel in the sky.  I started searching this morning online and come across this site and had to report it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

At the same time as a jet was flying by as I heard the jet engines passing overhead, I could see a small green light suddenly appear in the dark sky as I smoked a cigarette, and the speed of this green light was in the opposite direction of the sound as well as planes do not move this fast.  This was not a meteorite or shooting star as it was moving as the crow flies in the distance straight ahead.  I could tell that this was some sort of craft just by the way it was moving across the sky.  However this green light was not the jetliner overhead which I heard at the same time.  The plane in the sky was not military as it was not chasing the object it was just passing overhead as I live near an airport.  Show it was a green light I did not hear any noise besides the jetliner above and it was moving faster than any plane I have ever seen in my life!  I would say it was moving as fast as a shoo! ting star but this is no shooting star.","2333":"Bright silver triangle hovering in southwest sky making the shape of Deneb, Vega, Altair, Venus.

Three witnesses among family--First sighted on the way home, starting with two in a far distance, and continued as we pulled in the drive.  Two triangular shaped crafts circled our complex about 5 or 6 times within 20 minutes.  One had seven blinking lights and the other had only three; the one with seven blinking lights was leading the other craft the whole time. At one point, the leading craft approached a normal commercial airplane and disappeared, jumping from above to the left of us in around one second.  They then went around the back of the house and completely disappeared.  Aircraft noises separate from the crafts themselves were heard, possible reasoning behind circling such as watching or chasing them.

We pulled into the parking lot of our apartment complex, and started unloading the trunk.   My fianc\u00e9 told me to turn around and look behind me in the sky.  I immediately put my bags down and just watched in awe.  Right above the tree line there were three giant red-orange glowing lights.  They never pulsated.  They were in a triangular shape.  It hovered there for a bit, then I realized I needed to record it.  By the time I got my phone out it had raised a little in the sky and seemed less big.  It still hovered, but also rotated slightly.  We watched as one by one each light eventually went out.  We agreed that the weirdest thing was never actually seeing a shape.  When the lights went out, there was literally nothing there.  It was night time, but we could still see the sky and clouds.  It was as if there was a craft that was invisible except for the lights.  Immediately after the ufo disappeared, two helicopters came from two different directions.  I went inside shortly afterward.  There was never any sound to the ufo.  I have clear video of the sighting.","2338":"Large Bright orange\/yellowish orb, resembling a large star floating throughout  the sky. At work I saw something out my window in the corner of my eyes,  I stopped the machinery that I was using and got out to observe.  I noticed a bright orange\/yellowish light it was strange to my because it was significantly brighter than every other star in the clear sky.  I began watching and noticed it was hovering around in all different directions, not super fast but fast enough to see the significan motion.   As I snapped some pictures of the orb like brightness, and watched for several minutes as it moved from Far Eastern horizon to almost 12 o\u2019clock over my head. Every time I switched to record video of the anomaly my camera would focus in and capture the star and then disappear off screen.  The whole time it was visible to the naked eye but would come and go on my screen, I had an every feeling and extreme curiosity. Never seen anything like it.  What was this object?!  There seemed to be a slightly smaller white light making similar movements almost mirroring the orange light in its erratic \u201cfloating\u201d motions.  It may be worth noting that early in the evening me and another witness saw a large burst of light that lasted about 4 seconds, it was similar to a huge shooting star but more like a white fireworks display-- the other witness is an engineer--we both agreed that it was strange but figured it was a sizable meteor--agreeing that it was bigger, brighter and lasted longer than any shooting star we\u2019ve seen and exhibited a crackling, fire like display as it wizzes thru the sky. Man, I wish I knew what it is that I\u2019ve seen in the sky tonight. There\u2019s got to be an explainer.","2339":"10 lights scattered on the ground throughout the forest making a connection with a light in the sky UFO in Glacier National Park   \tToday a friend of mine reported an event that happened to him back in January of 2019.  I have no reason not to believe my friend because he thinks I\u2019m crazy that I have had many ghost experiences and he has often teased me about it in the past. \tIt started as he was restless one night and could not go back to sleep.  So at about 1:am in the morning, he went outside his cabin nestled in the mountains just on the southern outskirts of Glacier National Park in Montana to smoke a cigerette.  As he gazed up into the sky he watched what he first thought was a planet in the sky which would brighten and dim off on and on.  But it was\u2019nt until he was finishing his cigerette when he glanced up on a mountain across the river that he noticed a white light.  At first he thought \u2018why is there a hiker with a headlamp hiking at 1:am in the morning\u2019.  Then he noticed off in the distance about 2 miles away where he saw another orange light.  It was then that he looked around and noticed about a total of 10 lights scattered throughout the forest, hills and mountains.  He then realized that these lights were communicating with this light above him that he thought was a star or a planet.  He said such a bad feeling came over him that he went i! nside his cabin and locked the door. \tAbout a week later he was talking to a girl that lived in the cabin about 100 yards from him, and she said that on that same night that she had this horrible feeling come over her that she decided to lock there door. \tMy friend has tried many times to reason with this event.  Was it a car reflection in the distance that lit up the mountains?  For some reason was a secret military training drill going on with soldiers in the mountains at 1:am in the morning?  What could this have been?  But when he talks about the feeling that came over him and his neighbor as well as the light in the sky communicating with the ground lights, he tends to believe this to be the strangest and unexplained.

She sent me a picture to show how much snow she had received, only when I received the photo did we both see the UFO.  This was not obvious to her when she took the picture and neither of us knows that it was able to be seen with the naked eye.  The photo was taken on an iPhone.

On the evening of 2\/26\/19,, around  20:50 to 21:00 driving south on Rt.47 towards our home in South Hadley, we noticed a huge object, full of lights, hovering over the dairy farm on left of us.  Skinner Mountain was in the back of it.  It had a square configuration of lights  red, yellow, and white.  The corners each had a red light.   Couldn\u2019t tell if the outsides of the craft we rounded or not.  Almost seems it had 2 levels to it.  Overall size was maybe  60 x 60.  Initially, it was about 40 to 50 foot of the ground.  It moved slowly upwards (no sound) in a few seconds, up over the mountain which was  600 + feet.   My wife, and granddaughter all saw this.","2345":"Went outside to take out some trash.

A bright, glowing orb was first seen about 10 degrees above the western horizon beneath Spica.  It alternated colors in an 8 second cycle of red-invisible-gold-invisible-red as it moved slowly north, taking about 5 minutes to reach a point beneath Denebola.   It was brighter than the planet Jupiter that was visible in the southern sky.   The orb continued to move silently northward at the same altitude until it disappeared from sight behind a building.","2348":"My sighting occurred last Monday morning, March 18th.  I was looking out of my building from the 11th floor and noticed contrails, so I began to follow one.  Suddenly, there was a shimmering and a formation of about 20 of them appeared and sort of \u201cfollowed the leader\u201d like a flock of birds.  They\u2019d fly a bit, then head into this small and apparently lone cloud.  In a couple of seconds they\u2019d reappear from the cloud and repeat.  Watched this repeat itself for a about a minute then it passed over the building.  I would say it as a flock of birds but this was way too high for that and also they appeared to be silver and saucer\/diamond shaped. This was in North Kansas City in the center of the city, not out in the country.","2349":"Bright light (solid, not flashing) appeared in sky at a distance.  Traveled from south to north at rapid speed (approximate same speed as jet fighter).  However, after traveling for about 20 seconds, the light abruptly stopped and hovered for approx 5 seconds.

Abruptly stopped again for 5 seconds then disappeared and broke up into 3 smaller red lights which disappeared also disappeared themselves.","2350":"MADAR Node 106","2351":"Extremely fast bright light, almost ball shaped with a streak of light both in front and behind it.  Red light on the bottom. My wife and I had just laid down for the night.  I was watching the sky out our window when I saw a very bright white light with a red light on the bottom streak across the sky.  I would say it was almost ball shape, however it had a streak of light both in front and behind it.  It was a cloudy night, and this was below the cloud level.  I would say that this passed over about two miles Southwest of Isanti, MN, and was headed in a Northwest direction.   We have a double window and I could clearly see it pass through the first, however halfway through the second it disappeared.  I am experienced with different types of aircraft, and drones, and this was neither.  We do have the occasional aircraft fly over, and can hear them, this did not make a noise. I found this site while attempting to find other reports or sightings of this.  It was a little upsetting that my wife had already closed her eyes and could not confirm what I saw.","2352":"MADAR Node 148","2353":"Two small fast moving objects near clouds. On March 20 2019, about 6 pm, I was observing passing cumulus clouds when I saw an object. This object was rather small, moving at tremendous speed west to east.  The object appeared to be long and slender, about 5 times longer than it was thick.  It looked to be black in color, but that could not be verified.  It appeared to be pointed in front and tapered to the rear from it's thickest point.  Altitude is estimated to be about 6,000 feet, using the passing clouds as a reference.  I estimate the speed to be at least 500 mph.  It covered the visible arc from my viewing point in about 5 seconds.  This arc is about 45 degrees, give or take.  By the time I rounded the corner of my house for a better look, it was gone. About 3 minutes later, looking up to the West, I spotted an object that appeared to look like the first one.  This one was moving North to South at about half the speed as the first, but rapidly accelerated out of sight in an instant.","2354":"A white light coming from the sky that changed green before it fell in the field.","2355":"Please see attached video.

I was walking my dogs behind my house, as I do every night, and noticed an orange sphere moving very quickly across the sky in the south-southwest direction.  It appeared to be very high in the sky.  It did not have any of the characteristics of the aircraft that Memphis sees in its skies coming and going to MEMH. Firstly, it did not have flashing lights.  When the planes are headed directly towards your line of sight, you cannot see flashing lights, but they tend to appear yellowish-white; this craft was a solid, orange ball.   Secondly, it was going way too fast relative to its  apparent altitude.  Had it been a plane at that altitude, it would have been moving much slower across the sky.  Thirdly, when it finally dawned on me that what I was looking at might actually be a UFO, and I reached into my pocket to take out my phone, it instantly disappeared; as if you had just flipped a switch.  It was completely gone.  Since there were no clouds in the sky during this observation, it couldn\u2019t have gone behind a cloud.  The entire observation lasted only 10-12 seconds. For years I have made a minor hobby out of watching the FedEx planes coming and going in the Memphis skies, and I am completely certain that what I saw tonight, March 21, 2019, was not a plane or a helicopter.","2358":"while taking pics of strange color in clouds captured what looks to be a ufo my husband and I were outside enjoying the sun,  I noticed this strange color in the clouds near the sun,  so I got my phone out and began taking pics.

If it was a plane head light it would have been coming toward us.  There were no other lights, i.e. red or green wing lights or rear tail fin light.   As it moved to the left it got smaller and smaller then winked out.  We tried to see wings lights or tail light but there was nothing.  It just disappeared.","2361":"In the northern sky just west of the Big Dipper constellation over Taos Mountain on Taos Pueblo.  I noticed it because it looked star like but seemed flattened on the edges\/sides.  The light was not uniform.  It hovered and moved left and then right several times over the three minute period.  And, the lights on the bottom seemed to radiate out.  Not a spotlight but definitely lights.  Then it  slowly faded out.  Three minutes and a few seconds of viewing.","2362":"I was sitting outside on my porch step and was sky watching as I do every night when the weather is cooperating and happened to look up to the left (west) and saw an object with what looked like red and white lights moving in a circular direction, heading NE.  When it flew over there was no plane engine sound, but there was a low frequency humming sound.","2363":"Glowing green lights over beach. We were on the beach waiting for the moon rise.  The sky was full of stars. Many planes in flight as well. We saw two light green glowing lights in a line fly over our heads. They each looked oval in shape. Hard to determine how up but closer to the earth than the stars. The lights moved slowly above us up the coast from the south to the north. They stayed in sync with each other. They made no noise. We have (2) drones and this did not look like anything we had seen before.","2364":"Blue-violet light in the sky. At 9:15pm, I and 8 others were outside smoking in South Weymouth, when one of us who was looking north by north west in the sky towards Quincy, Ma., mentioned a blue light.  The light which was blue violet in color was pulsating from semi-intense to almost completely unnoticeable.  It would seem important to mention that there was no discernable pattern to the pulsating.   Also 2 days ago an identical light was photographed in Quincy, Ma, and posted to Facebook with a caption \"did anyone see this light last night?\"","2365":"Clear and very still night.  There were lots of stars visible in the sky so a friend and I were watching.  Something caught my eye which appeared to be a shooting star.  I followed it with my eyes and noticed there were several lights in the shape of a triangle.  The body of the craft appeared to be translucent.  Was completely soundless and moving much faster than any aircraft I have seen.  My friend did finally get a look at it also but only maybe 3-5 seconds.","2366":"It really scared me, but nothing really happened after that. Well I was looking at the sky through my window, when I noticed a well...a UFO in the sky  it was a disk shape with a small light approaching the bottom  when I went to tell someone I was only gone for about thirty seconds because everyone was to busy, but thirty seconds later when I came back it was gone!

Every night I look up to the Big Dipper, have since childhood.  Tonight I looked up but there were two extra stars to the left of the cup end the two were moving in a northern direction evenly spaced,  1 behind the other the one behind began gaining on the other then they seemed to merge to become one.  At that point within seconds the light broke up into 4 individual lights darting off at high speed each in a direction of their own at a north south east and west.   I have never seen anything like this. I called to my wife to witness it.  she thought I was loosing it!

At the same time, there were 6 airplanes with white tailing behind them high in the sky over northwest Tucson, Az.","2370":"Cloudless sunny afternoon sighting of 3 large fireballs and many smaller ones seen through binoculars. My daughter called for me to come outside because her and her sister could see something strange in the sky.  When I went out I saw 3 orange-ish balls of light in a rough isosceles triangle.  I immediately sent my daughter back in to get her father and the binoculars.  When they came out my husband looked through the binoculars and exclaimed that there were many smaller ones too.  We all took turns looking and there were roughly 50 smaller ones between the bigger 3 that were nearly impossible to see with the naked eye. At first glanc,e the large ones looked like stationary explosions, but through the binoculars you could see them moving in place at different rates.  They looked eerily similar to what protein folding looks like.  We got out our telescope and kept observing until we couldn't see them anymore.  They slowly spread out but still stayed in a rough triangle.   Eventually, we could only see one, and then none.  This was all during a cloudless sunny afternoon.","2371":"White light turned  very bright 2 times ...then blinked out.

I was on an on ramp to get onto 91 south in the Windsor Locks area and I saw a flat dark disk with two bright lights on it.  I initially thought it was an airplane however when I pulled my car over to take a longer look it had disappeared.  There were no trees or faulty sight lines blocking it--it was too high up in the air.   It disappeared in less than ten seconds.","2373":"We were waiting at a restaurant outside and someone pointed out a strange object in the sky.  It was red and yellow in color and had a triangular shape, shortly after we noticed another much smaller object orbiting the larger one.  It moved very slowly and was rotating slowly.  It was headed westward we watched it until it was out of spite (sic.  Sight).   It went out of sight at about 6:50 PM.","2374":"Single point of light covering 1\/5th of clear sky south to north then reversing retracing path with side flashes. Single point of light traveling south to north, slightly east of directly overhead.  Appeared as a star but moving fast enough to cover 1\/5th of sky in 3-5 min.  Traveled from region of Sirius toward Ursa Major passing through the bottom of the cup of Ursa toward Polaris.   Stopped two finger widths beyond Ursa, then reversed direction, appearing to follow the same path back, until it disappeared.   Immediately after passing overhead moving south, several streaks of light flashed east and west in shallow angles perpendicular to the object's path.","2375":"Bright \"star\" quickly changing directions for 3 to 4 minutes untill it just vanished.  Star \"joyride!\" Noticed a star moving at 90 degree turns quickly and eraticly changing directions faster than anything I've witnessed before.  It did this for about 3 to 4 minutes.  No sound. Basically a star on some joyride.  I know what I saw.","2376":"A fast moving ball of light in the night sky Hanging out with my small group of friends at the waverly skatepark we were getting ready to pack up as it was dark and we were tired but we decided to just sit around for awhile.  Some time had passed and we were looking at the stars and one friends had asked us if any of us knew why a certain star was so bright.  I told him it was probably the north star but after looking at what he saw it was in the middle of the Big dipper constellation and had started moving after we started looking at it.  The Object was a bright white light.  It was a clear night sky with no clouds so all the stars around us were visible.  When the \u201cstar\u201d or object had started moving it was incredibly fast and moved in a strange zig zag pattern which is abnormal for any kind of plane.  After we watched it start moving for about 1 minute, the light it was emitting started to fade and in roughly 5 seconds completely went dark. After another ten seconds it appear again but was a slightly darker color and was yellow this time and also faded out of view.  After the second time of it fading we never saw it again","2377":"Three night lights in triangle formation, hovering over AZ town before slowly moving off on 3\/23\/19 I was driving east bound, having turned off AZ 84, when I spotted 3 bright lights in the night sky.  The lights were white with some shall bits of blue and appeared circular in shape.  Initially they were in an arrow tip formation, with one being in the middle and the other two on its left and right sides.  There is very little air pollution in this area. As I was driving I couldn\u2019t immediately stop to video these lights.  By the time I was able to stop the light on the left side of the formation was completely gone; I did not see it move off in any direction, it was just gone.  The light at the middle hovered the entire time as I videoed the light that was on the right side slowly circle and then move off to the west.  Eventually that light disappeared and I moved back to Video the light that had been in the middle, hovering.  It started to slowly move to the northeast direction until it, too, disappeared. The whole incident, from me noticing the lights, during videoing time and them moving off and disappearing was approximately 7-9 minutes.  It was a clear night with no clouds or wind or dust. I was alone while I witnessed these lights. I am a 54-year old female, attorney, with no history of any previous unexplained objects encounters.  I have in my possession two videos, one being nearly 5-minutes long of the light moving off to the west and a shorter one (approximately 1.5 minutes long) video of the light that was originally in the middle of the formation move off to the north-east.  I comment on this video that this particular light was stationery for nearly 5-minutes while I videoed the other light.  Both videos are grainy but the lights are visible.","2378":"Object of bright light over Long Island NY coast Out my window in the distance, I observed a very bright white light with no defined shape moving low and very slowly, almost hovering, I was looking for the northern lights tonight that may be seen in NY, a rare occurrence.   At first I thought this white light was part of it but quickly understood that it wasn\u2019t.  It was dark and in comparison to a plane in the sky at the same time with flashing lights I determined after a few moments that this was not a plane and I could not understand what it was.  We live off the coast by the water and in a busy flight path, so I am familiar with seeing planes. After taking my eye off of it for a second, I looked again and noticed that the object turned right and was going in the opposite direction.  It was quite a distance away, but it looked circular\/slightly oval, black with a bright white light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It almost looked like an airplane, however it was moving very weirdly and going at a high speed.  We only seen it for about 30 seconds before we couldn\u2019t spot it again.   We had thought a olane had crashed at first, but there was no noise indicating that a plane had crashed nearby.  It had two flashing lights on it, one red and one white.   It was hard to get a shape because of its speed, but the front looked like the nose of a plane and had a weird crescent shape in the back.

I returned to bed and on my way to bed, I could see a particularly bright red pulsing light stationary towards the west over the ocean. I watched it for a minute through our window over the bed and my wife awaken and I told her she has to see this.   She popped up and instantly saw what at first to me had looked like a very bright Mars but by the time she got up and was observing it it had doubled in magnitude.  You could see all the other stars in the sky around it which had there normal bluish color but this was orange red and it began pulsing.  We both were in amazement as to what it was.  It remained stationary.  After several minutes of it getting progressively brighter, all of a sudden it got very bright then completely just vanished.  It did not fly away but just went out.   I am a retired school teacher and my wife a real estate agent and are rational people but this was as clear as it could be.  We have not seen! anything like it before over the ocean at night here at our beach home.  Unexplainable both of us felt as if it knew we were watching it and disappeared, but then again we do believe in life on other planets but this took us by surprise.  And all the facts of the visual observation are facts but the feeling part we understand is subjective however it was very strange feeling watching it just disappear when all the backdrop of stars remain plenty bright.

Went outside to clean my BBQ.. looked up and saw a hovering on\/off light very high up in the sky, knew it wasn't a plane because it just hovered, possibly a drone, nope, up to high, about the same level as planes flying over PDX (20k. ft. est.)..  clear blue skies, with occasional passing clouds coming up from the South..  the position of the object was aprox. in the NW sky, basically over N\/NE PDX from my POV being in NE PDX.. what got me was the rotation, every 5 seconds or so, it would get really bright, then almost vanish, but not quite.. made me think it was a metallic object reflecting the morning sunshine during the craft rotation.. weather balloon ??.. not likely, stayed in the same spot, didn't appear to go up or down.. so I go in the house, do some dishes, wash up the bbq utensils, took about 20mins., go back outside, look up, and it's still there, in the same spot,  still the same on and off flashing\/reflection from the sun..  but this time my neighb! ors are outside and I call them over to take a peek, just for verification that i'm not seeing things, and sure enough they seen the same object.. Anyways, so a large cloud rolls in from the South, and as soon as the cloud broke away, it's gone, just like that, didn't see it leave, but something was there, for almost a good half hour, something was there, just hovering, shining in and out.. definetly not a star either, too bright outside.. but what got me was how brilliant the light reflecting off it was when the sun did hit it..  2nd time in  the past 31 of my 54 years that I saw something sky-high in broad daylight that didn't fit.","2382":"I was looking up at the sky and something caught my eye to the east.

The UFO was in constant movement\/ shifting shapes not radiating light, dimmed yellow in appearance. It was higher than full grown pinetrees that were in sight next to the ufo, on the right side (trees approximately 8 feet high). It was whatsoever not right next to the trees, but far away, high in the sky. It was a pretty blue sky day and the uap was approximately 1 mile visible to an Elementary School. I was driving while this was happening and only was able to capture about 2 seconds of the ufo on my cellphone video, where you can see a yellow spot behind pine trees, before it disappeared.  Not flying away or zooming away, but here one second gone the next.  It seemed more like a clocking, then disappearing.

I am an attorney and an extreme skeptic of things such as this, but I am unnerved.   I saw a vertical row of red lights with a blue light to the right side of the object.  I see multiple planes daily in this area so my instinct was that it was simply a plane.  The object, however, hovered.  Meaning it was stationary for a few seconds which was odd because it was very visible although distant.  As I tried to process if it was actually hovering or not, it shot straight up in the sky a great distance but still in view, leaving no streak of light.  It moved in a manner that no plane could move.   I was in shock at that point and then the object dropped down to where it was very quickly and did so on a right outward angle.  It hovered for another second and then shot off to the right, seemingly in a straight line and vanished.  Moments later, two white lights appeared which to be normal aircraft flying in the same vicinity as where I saw the object.  The object I saw was not a plane, it was not a star, it was not a meteor.  I could see clearly that it was a flying object but I could only make out the read and blue lights that made it appear horizontal.  The colors were more like police lights.  The erratic movement of the object is what leads me to question.  I have never seen anything fly like that in my life.   I am an adult female, professional mother of two.  I saw something!

We threw open the window and tried to listen for any noise or to see anything.  There was a low grumbling noise similar to rolling thunder, and within a few moments, another multicolored bright flash lit the sky and backyard.

The light came and went along with green and blue lights and a small amount of red light. We opened the window to see if we could hear anything, and there were rumbling sounds that were like distant thunder (but constant), and then a very loud zapping sound, as if from an electric wire snapping and what appeared to be flashes like sparks above the house. Several more times the bright flashes of colors and white light appeared until we ran out of the room to wake up my family.  By the time they came to look, there was no sign of any lights, any sounds whatsoever and the sky appeared to be a pink color.

Also, my father heard the loud zapping noise from the other side of the house, but couldn't see the lights from where he was. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere, and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a highly reliable witness.  PD))","2409":"Driving down clover dale road towards the kuna road cross street I saw a huge green fireball fall from the sky and into the earth.   It lasted only a few seconds and was at approximately 4:50 a.m.","2410":"A very bright white light traveling eat to west. A very bright white light traveling roughly east to west.  No trail noted.   I did not hear a any sound over the radio in my vehicle. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter, It seemed to be a bit larger than the stars I can view from home, definitely not as large as the moon.  I was driving my pick up truck,  I would estimate about a 20-30 degree arc. Mount Ascutney peak would be at roughly 45 degrees or less. At this time of day the sky is getting bright enough to obscure most of the fainter stars.  I have observed the ISS in full dark.  This was moving much faster than that. This was about 1\/2 mile north of the Cornish\/ Windsor covered bridge on route 12A.  On the New Hampshire side of the CT river. I will attempt to snap a photo in the morning of my view in that area. ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))","2411":"Bright white light large round looked like a very large falling star but than curved slightly to the right and up than disappeared.","2412":"Sun was just starting to come up, sky was clear and we (my daughter and I) could see the moon very bright to our left as we were driving.   I noticed a very very bright round object pass us to the left traveling from the East heading West.  I have never seen anything fly so fast, and it seemed to just drop beyond the horizon, almost as if it landed somewhere idk.  We thought maybe it was a missile or something, but it didn't have a tail.  Strange, to say the least, and scary.   I'm 48 yrs old and have never ever seen anything like it in my life.","2413":"Mysterious light North of New Windsor Rd, MD. I was driving on New Windsor Rd (31), towards New Windsor, at about 6:20am.  There is farm land, with patches of trees, and a few houses around this route. I saw a single bright white light to my left.  It was rounded, with no other discernable shape.  I didn\u2019t hear any noises. I\u2019m not sure where it originated from as it appeared out of my blind spot when I noticed the light.  I would have to guess about North\/North-East. It made a quick descent at about a 90 degree, and then curved back to being straight.  The best way I can describe the flight pattern is by saying it flew the path of an old metal slide facing away from you.  It disappeared in the tree line.","2414":"I saw a quick streak of white light across my windshield looking west.  It went from south to north. It was west of Springfield over the area of Agawam.  Maybe a piece of the satellite India shot down?  It was about 12 inches across my windshield.","2415":"Driving South on a well lit suburban street.  Witness was in the front passenger seat and saw a well-defined bar of bright yellow light flash suddenly into view.  The light had the clarity and intensity of a performance grade laser.  The object was angled about 45 degrees from horizon and moved out of view as we drove along.","2416":"I saw a triangle shaped object traveling slowly from south to north east with red lights at the top and bright lights on the sides. 03\/29\/19 Just after midnight (12:15 am 03\/29\/19) pretty clear night, lights were below the clouds if there were any. I shut off the TV, the room was dark and I looked out the south facing window of our Lakeville, MN, home as I often do to reflect before bed time.  We face a large field about a half mile across with new housing development on the other side.  There is a very large new apartment building straight across from us.  I saw a small bright light in the distant sky above the apartment building to our south.  This is common because we live on a  flight path to MPLS Airport. I watched for a couple minutes and the light seemed to be still so I decided it was a star but it was too low and bright to be a star.  I watched a few more minutes then stood up to leave the room.  I noticed it had moved a little.  I thought I want to see what this slow bright airplane is.  Usually the lights go from just visible to an obvious airplane with landing lights and sound over our house in less then five minutes. A few more minutes (probably 2 or 3) passed and the light was noticeably closer.  I saw pulsating or revolving red lights at the top of a sort of triangle.  The red lights seemed to revolve but the bright lights seemed to radiate down the triangle from the red lights.  It was coming straight at me from the south so I decided to wait and see what this was. It approached closer and angled off to the east toward Saint Paul.  The image stopped getting bigger but I could see it pretty clearly.  The red lights appeared more stationery but flashing.  The bright lights seemed to be traveling down at an angle like they were following a rope from the top of a sail on a sailboat.  The lights came down both sides from the top in a tag along format.  Both sides didn't appear to be synchronized but both were the same.  The light seemed to travel back and forth between the bottom corners, not as bright as the others and more random.  There was very little, if any noise, from it but I felt I did detect a slight distant jet engine sound. It moved further away to the north east until it was back to being a strange bright slow moving light in the sky.  I went to bed.  I told my wife about it this morning.  She found this web site and encouraged me to send in my report.","2417":"Sun was not up yet, saw a disc shape brightly lit just hovering horizontally.  Then it moved to the right and went vertical.   I took photos and all I got was a vacant sky, the object would not show up on the photos. Weird. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Stuck in downtown Atlanta morning traffic going 75 north, a blue light appears out of no where and darts across the dark sky.  The light was bouncing up and down as if it was loosing control.  Looked like someone\u2019s headlight in the sky except it was a blue foggy light. Looked like the light was coming from behind clouds.  Happened so fast all I could say was wowwww.  Was not a plane.  The light was to big and bouncing up and down while traveling at an unexplainable speed then disappeared out of nowhere.","2420":"Small green light moving across the sky that quickly shifted downward towards the ground.

Bluish-Green linear light moving at high rate of speed from east to west approximately 3 miles North of Hartsfield (Atlanta) Airport.  Crossed path of commerial flights taking off from airport perpendicular to flight paths.  So fast that it made commerial jets look motionless!  I estimate altitude at approximately 1,000 feet.","2424":"Strange moving lights aligned in a straight line. bright lights (about 14) were seen moving from lower in the horizon and disappearing straight up into the atmosphere and vanishing. There was only  5 to 6  lights appearing in the line at one time. Photos were taken. This occurred in about Southwest direction of Fort Atkinson WI","2425":"Triangular craft spotted.  I have reported this case to the MUFON and received no response despite hours of phone interviews. Months later I had to contact the investigator only to be told that what I saw was indeed unidentified.  I have amazing video of what I saw, strange occurrences in the sky within the following day, and strange occurrences that have happened to me after.  On the night of April 20, 2019, I was driving down my neighborhood street to the corner gas station. It was a clear, dark desert night. There are no tall trees or obstructions in this area.  When I was driving, I saw an odd light pattern in the sky that caught my interest, but as I was driving I was unable to stop.  I spent roughly fifteen minutes at the corner store before proceeding back home on the same path I had come.  At this time, 9:20 PM, I saw the light pattern again and I was able to safely stop and record. I have a twenty-second video, but I watched for around 10-15 minutes before I could no longer see. What I saw was triangular, with three white lights. The craft was low, too low to be considered normal. Too slow to be considered normal. Too quiet to be considered normal. It would stop for seconds, it would disappear for seconds. It just seemed as it was lazily passing over the neighborhood. It should be noted that there is an airport in my city as well as an Army base, but both are considerably far from where the incident occurred.  Very odd things followed for months that I do not wish to publish here but will discuss with a NUFORC member. I truly believe I have caught a UFO in film and the events surrounding will only support the story. I am a scientific person to my core and I have grown up on military bases, so I would not jump to far-fetched conclusions unless I really believed.","2426":"It was a summer night approximately 1:30 2:00 am a very clear night. I was walking home through a park and the moon was pretty bright approx 65-75% illuminated which was the reason I was able to see the craft above the town the moonlight sort of glistened off it. It was hovering well above the treeline silent it was stark black round but most definitely a solid nuts and bolts craft. I took video and pictures from the park to my house a couple blocks away and kept filming at my house. I also went inside after one and a half hours and got two family members to come out and view the crafter continued to watch for another hour or so the craft still same spot silently hovering however there were periods where it would begin a pulsating of a variety of colored lights. Around 3:00 am I took my family members inside when I came back out the craft was gone. My guess on size is 22 ft approximate height 2,000 ft maybe less.","2427":"Was outside with my dog in the backyard.  Saw something very bright and flying way too slow to be an airplane. No blinking light no noise.  Sped up a little , got bright than the light disappeared as if it just went out.  I did not see it take off quickly or anything like that .  Just disappeared.   Sky was clear, no clouds. Not the first time I have seen something in this area, I just felt to stupid to report it, like I would be called crazy.","2428":"Sighting of two triangle UFOs, Uncasville August 1st at approximately 9:10 pm. Sighting on August 1, 2019 at 9:10 PM, approximately.  Location North of I-395 and Route 32 intersection.  I have a Snap Chat recording of the sighting. We debated sending it in.  As I was heading North on I-395, about a quarter mile before the first Montville Exit and in the general direction of the Oxoboxo River, I spotted what appeared to be the lights of an airplane in my center field of view.  Initially my head thought of a triangle ufo, not entirely sure why, due to the common red taillight and two white lights on the wings.  This changed a second later, as I noticed the red tail light was abnormally close to the two front white lights. I further noticed how close the lights were in proximity to me. This realization came to clarity when my headlights began to reveal (as I headed down the hill of the road) the defined figure of a triangle object 100 to 200 feet North and about 100 feet above the I-395.  The side bore 45 degree angled beams that combined the top of the craft with the bottom. Between the beams was a lighter silver surface enclosing the craft. The visible bottom of the craft, which appeared to have a small, carbon colored black triangle in the center, was relatively flat. There may have been small black circles on the bottom. The craft was dark grey and silver like metal but different. It wasn\u2019t metal.  Suddenly, I noticed that about ten feet behind this craft was an exact second.  These two vessels had no propulsion devices and were not hovering like if they had a rotor like a drone or helicopter. They made no noise and moved Eastbound at about 8 miles per hour, smoother than anything I have ever seen move before. They were not tethered to one another and did not wiggle or move about as they slid through the air. It was as though they were untouched by the environment, the wind and gravity. I want to describe them as being unbound to physics by the sheer perfection in the way that they moved, with no external force to effect them.  I drove under them and caught my reaction on Snap Chat as I was fumbling to find my phone and open up the app.  I lost sight of them after that. I did not stop.  I just watched Tucker Carlson last night (the 19th) with his guest and segment of the UFO\u2019s and the Russian Jets that were shot down.","2429":"A star-like light which diverged into two lights which moved apart from one another and faded from view in the night sky. My girlfriend and I stepped out onto my front porch and I immediately looked up at the stars as I usually do. I noticed an out of place very bright star with an apparent magnitude of around 1 in the northeastern sky, about 60 degrees above the horizon. Almost immediately after spotting it, the light broke into two lights of an apparent magnitude of about 0. These lights moved away from one another at a steady velocity and both faded in brightness until they were no longer visible.  One moved northwards, the other southwards. They each moved across about 1\/10 of the sky before they faded from sight in less than 5 seconds. I saw them diverge and move apart, and when I pointed it out my girlfriend commented on the bright moving light, as she only saw one. We are both college students with a paper published in the field of astronomy, and have both spent a lot of time looking at stars and the night sky. These objects moved similarly to a satellite, but the bright! ness was unusual. Unless I happened to look up as two unusually bright satellites crossed paths, I cannot think of any explanation for their identity.","2430":"Craft recorded Saw a light move then fade took video.","2431":"Three lights seen fly over mountain. Early morning, I stepped outside and saw three separate lights. Each was  roughly the size of a vehicle. The formed a triangle, but seemed to be independent of each other.  Two lower points were yellow, the upper middle point was orange.  They quickly ascended the height of the surrounding mountains and just as fast hugged the top of a ridge and passed over and out of sight heading west.  They did not continue upward, but back down the opposite side of the mountain.  They were VERY large, made no noise. They traveled at a steady and high speed.  I have lived in the La Quinta cove my entire life and have never seen an aircraft move over these mountains they way they did.","2432":"stream of lights in a perfect line my friend yelled holy cow look at all these stars headed the same direction. i couldnt find my glasses when i finally did my friend and husband were watching a perfect line of far off light streaming across the sky. they appeared to come out of no where. some were in doubles my friend lost count after 38 and we stood there another min or two. before it ended. there were no sound and didn't appear to have the red and blue lights flashing most aircraft are required to have. there was a aircraft going diagonal to the lights that should have been able to see the lights.","2433":"My friend and i were pulling in the driveway around 6:20 pm on 12\/22\/2019. We seen around 15 lights flying in a perfect line without making a sound. We watched for about 15 minutes as they would disappear at the same point in the shy. Right up until the last one make it to that same spot. Then gone like the rest and without making a sound.","2434":"Points of light moving across the sky Looked to southwest sky and seen what I thought was a satellite then another appears then one every five seconds in a straight line for five minutes heading northeast.","2435":"Ball of light Me and my partner was driving back from a transport to Parkersburg and we was headed back to Charleston when in the sky we noticed a bright light that was stationary for a second or so and the it moved to the left at a high rate of speed.  At first I thought it was the airport light but it was to fast and it never returned in the sky.  After looking in the sky for a few mins I started to tell my partner what I saw and he interrupted me and finished what I was saying which the same story.  About 15 mins later I was looking in the sky trying to repeat the experience and all of a sudden in a different are of the sky further away I seen the same thing happen again this time my partner stated that he seen it before I could say something. After driving for another 30 min we see the glow of Charleston and we can see the airport light which is yellowish on on bulb and green on the second one and no where near as bright as the anomaly we seen earlier.","2436":"The weird 25 lights\/objects appeared and moved in the line in the sky at night time. We were travellers with motorhomes\/campervans around outback in Broken Hill, NSW, Australia and we were chatting outside and beside the motorhomes at the night. One observer walked out of the group to the dark area and saw the weird spots appeared in the line in the sky. The observer called them to see the extra-terrestrial activity and wanted to share our experience. There appeared to be a series of objects that moved in a straight line, observed as a line of lights\/objects moving up into the sky. All moved upwards at the same time, in vision, it looked like separate objects following each other. They moved upwards and as they went overheard at a certain point, they disappeared. Each light disappeared when it reached that point. Some of them moved sporadically to the left or right then below and up again before they disappeared . It took approximately the minute for them to move from horizon to directly above us when they disappeared one by one. There were many at least 25. We did not count them as we were amazed at the time and did not know what it was and did not think to record or count them until a few seconds later. We have a recording on my phone. No trial was left. This was late at night we could not see the object, only the light on each, which was the size of the head of a small nail head, approximately 1-2 mm in diameter. They all appeared white in colour. No sound was heard by people with normal hearing. There were 10 witnesses saw it. There was a clear night and half-moon beside the lights or objects as it appeared, they were very far away but before the stars and near or not far from the moon. I will post video in USB key.","2437":"Daytime disappearing triangles in the sky. Was driving down south on a 3-lane highway around 5 in the afternoon when I noticed 5 dark triangular shapes in the sky moving slowly in a V formation plus 2 separate triangles directly in front of the 5. The other 2 were side by side. All were headed west. I instinctively slowed down and I noticed another car to my left did the same thing. The other driver was also looking at the triangles in the sky. After about 3 minutes, the triangles stopped moving and then seemed to disappear one by one, until they were all gone. I turned to look at the other driver and we looked at each other and we both made the same puzzled gesture. The objects did not look like any aircraft that I've seen before. They did not emit any lights.","2438":"UAP above our house object appeared to be still, roughly 50 feet above our home, displaying 5 white lights; no noise; no aircraft near our home. No ambient lighting to cause this. We have a photo of the incident.","2439":"Dancing lights over Montbello (Denver) Driving home from Montbello (Denver) to Brighton- my husband and I see several lights, too many to count! It started as a circle and the lights multiplied and the circle shape became huge! Some lights appeared and others disappeared. It was like they were performing. At one point all the lights went all ways and one went right over us. We were so shocked my husband stopped right in the middle of the street. All the lights looked like they were coming from above and all the sudden they all became one light and then there was nothing. The lights all were white color.","2440":"Saw a large white ball with fiery tail, slow moving- red tail first, then orange, then white, then it completely vanished. Saw a large white ball with fiery tail, slow moving.  Red tail first, then orange, then white, then just completely vanished.  All of us were completely in shock, and the kids were very excited about the UFO.  Our coordinates at the exact time of viewing were: 28\u00b003'40.5\"N 82\u00b032'32.8\"W  The event seemed to be happening directly to the East of our location, moving in southernly direction before disappearing.","2441":"round spinning Hi Last week on the 17th of December I was in my back yard trying to finish up some yard work before the darkness set in it was probably around 530-600 when I happen to look up and notice an object in the sky.  I star gaze every night and know exactly where every star in the sky sits, and know what airplanes look like when they fly overhead, and this was not a normal star or an aircraft. I have a video  that I recorded of the object and it is clear to see this object is not what one can call normal.  It appears to be round and spinning. My husband and I both observed the object for about 5 min before it disappeared. I live in Bakersfield Ca, and this is not the first time my husband and I have witnessed an object such as this. The event prior to this one happened in San Simeon as we were driving back from Morro Bay to our hotel on Hwy 1 an object similar in appearance popped into existence and shown very bight for about a minute and disappeared just like it appeared.  Unfortunately, I was driving and could not video this event. I am not completely positive of the exact date, but it did happen in February of this year.","2442":"I was going to church Wednesday evening 12\/18\/2019 and it was 6:57 p.m. I hit a stop sign where i was going to turn a left. When i looked to the left i looked up to the sky and seen yellow lights, about five of them connected to each other. They were so close to each other they looked like 5 little bulbs of christmas lights. I looked back down because there was a tree beside them, so in my mind i thought they were actually christmas lights, but when i looked up again i realized they weren\u2019t because that tree wasn\u2019t decorated. Plus that tree was very tall and its not the kind of tree people hang lights on. The lights were at the very top beside the tree. I turned left and looked up again to keep track of them but they disappeared. All this happened in a span of a minute. I told my girlfriend about them but we never saw them again. There was also a few planes in the sky, kind of close to the object\/objects( i don\u2019t know if it was one object with five lights) b! ut not to close. My girlfriend did tell me that she had seen on facebook that someone had also posted seeing ufo\u2019s the day before in around this area I believe.","2443":"I was sitting at my kitchen table and I saw a saucer with blue lights, ran outside, it was cruising low and slow from South Mountain traveling northeast towards Scottsdale","2444":"Around 9 o\u2019clock, I was getting out of my car and happened to look up into the sky to look at the stars. It was dark outside, so I know it wasn\u2019t a plane reflecting the sun\u2019s light. It was a very bright orange, almost neon-looking, and yellow color. It was shaped like a triangle and moving faster than I\u2019ve ever seen anything move before. It made turns that an airplane or meteor would be unable to make. The triangle shape eventually faded down to a single orange dot and then disappeared.","2445":"100's of round blobs or circles, clear or silver, shiny, color change to red or blue and back hovering over & around tower. Well, here we go again. This is my second sighting this year. My granddaughter and I stopped at Wendy\u2019s on Reynolda Rd. in Winston-Salem, NC. While I was accessing my Wendy\u2019s app for coupons, she said, \u201cGrandma what are those things up there?\u201d I looked out my right passenger window and looked up. Above and around the very tall cell tower behind Wendy\u2019s were what seemed like hundreds of round blobs moving all around but they stayed in the same area. We got out the car for a better look. They seemed clear or silver colored, but shiny. Some turned red and some turned blue. A few even changed shape to have a tail or something pointing behind, or in front. of them. They were not up very high in the sky, at least no further than the cell tower. They were definitely round before shifting shape. We tried to capture videos from my cell phone, but when we looked through the camera you could not see them. (After we got home I checked the videos on my phone and you coul! d make out a few of the objects.) After about 20 minutes, the group of objects moved to the right of the sky but at the same height level. They seemed to just disappear after that. I do not know how huge the objects would be on ground level. But clearly they were large. Some would move towards each other and then pull back. This time my granddaughter saw them first and brought them to my attention. The last time I brought the UFSs we saw to her attention (reported on this site). It was almost like when you blow out a bunch of bubbles at one time (but many more) except bubbles do not stay at one level, they either float up and then burst or fall down and burst or touch each other and burst or cling to each other and then burst. I reviewed this writing with my granddaughter, and she confirms it is an accurate depiction of what we both saw. She said, Grandma we have got to get a real camera if we keep seeing these things.\u201d I agree.","2446":"Er schoot een fel wit driehoekig object boven ons huis weg.

The lights were whitish blue and slightly oblong horizontally.  I checked every possible cause for these lights (reflection, car headlights, streetlights) and could not explain them. I watched them for approximately two minutes and then I got the feeling that I was being observed.  As soon as I had that thought, the lights shut off like someone flipped a switch.  They didn\u2019t shoot off into the sky or slowly fade.  I am 60 years old and have never seen anything like that in my life!","2449":"I was driving to work and i saw a ball of fire falling from the sky in the far distance. At first i thought &quot;WOW&quot; a shooting I was driving to work and i saw a ball of fire falling from the sky in the far distance. At first i thought \"WOW\" a shooting star but as I continued to look it didn't appear to be that at all. I'm no expert but I've seen falling stars before and this did not look like what I have seen before. whatever it was it was definitely on fire and it there were flashes of light as pieces were breaking of the object. Im sure that i couldnt have been the only one to see this.. believe me it was hard to miss. Maybe it'll make the news.. ??????","2450":"8 lights arranging in a circular shape with one circle in the center. The 8 lights appeared to move inward and outward of the center light the same way that it would look to see a humans lungs expanding. Some of the lights would disappear as I watched. The lowest number of lights I seen including the center light, which remained constant, were 5. If looking at the face of the clock it would have been at 2:00 positioning from  Orion\u2018s belt.  I went in my home and after 10 minutes went back out to find it.  It was farther away and now at what seemed like a 3:00 position.  I\u2019m not sure exactly what i had seen but I can honestly say that in all my nights looking at the sky I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.","2451":"4 Bright Sphere like objects in North Las Vegas Was outside on a very clear day in NLV with my neighbor, My neighbor saw 3 bright sphere like objects in the sky very very high up!  I then looked an saw myself all 3 then saw a 4th.  My husband came outside and we got a telescope and binoculars & still saw objects which were moving closer together.  What was really strange was when a plane came passed ( way below the objects ) the objects cloaked and then came back after the plane was gone!    This all took about 15 minutes.  Our postal lady also looked up and saw the objects after she asked what we were all looking at so total of 4 people.  But 3 people definitely saw these very real Sphere & bright objects in the sky today.","2452":"Disk of light with a crescent of rainbow colored lights I was taking my grandchildren home from school yesterday, 12\/19\/2019.We were traveling west along Northpark Dr. in Kingwood, Texas at about 3:45 or so in the afternoon.We were caught in slow moving traffic, and I noticed the most unusual sight. At first I thought I was looking at the sun through cloud cover.\u00a0 On the left side of the sun-like object there was a crescent of rainbow colored light covering maybe the disk, like the sliver of a crescent moon.\u00a0 The rainbow light glowed a bit outside of the disk area. I thought it was the sun and maybe there were ice crystals in the atmosphere diffracting the light making the very unusual image.\u00a0 Then I looked around the solid part of the windshield and noticed the actual sun shinning further south.\u00a0 It was close to the disk.\u00a0 I really don't know how far away it was. The disk did not move or change.\u00a0 It held its perfectly disk-like shape for several minutes.\u00a0 I asked the girls to look at the disk and the sun, making sure that my mind wasn't playing tricks on me.\u00a0 They both saw the same thing. By the time I could get to my purse and phone, the image was fading.\u00a0 It didn't zoom away or disappear, it just faded.\u00a0 But the perfect round geometic form never morphed.

Approaching the Hartselle exit he noticed these lights in the sky around 5:39pm  and stopped to photograph them. Multiple cars were also stopped taking photos. The lights in the image seem to be oblong but he said that was his camera as the lights were a solid circle. They hung around about 5 minutes then disappeared. I don\u2019t know what they would want in Hartselle but Redstone Arsenal is in Huntsville,Al, about 25-30 minutes away by car. I\u2019m assuming a few seconds in ufo speed.","2455":"Exeter, Exeter Township, Reading, PA around 6:00 PM\/ET, I noticed a bright yellow sphere\/orb in the sky. It just stayed there, not moving.  I saw airplanes fly over and under it and it was bigger than them. I asked my son-in-law to come outside and look at it and he thought it was strange.  It was too big to be a drone or weather balloon. It hovered in the sky for about 40 minutes and disappeared after I took pictures of it with my cell phone.  This is the second time I\u2019ve seen something similar to this in the area. My last report was on 10\/05\/19 in Mount Penn which was posted on this site. I have pictures of that sighting as well.  Also interesting to note was there were a bunch of sightings on 10\/05\/19 in the area surrounding Mount Penn with photos and a video of this object.  I used an ultraviolet filter on the 12\/19 photograph and the outline faintly resembles the shape of the picture I took on 10\/05\/19. I am a paralegal and work in the law department for a large insurance company. I don\u2019t have any explanation for these things but I find it fascinating.","2456":"Gray triangle with large dim lights on each point. Shortly after entering our hot tub on Thursday evening (12\/19\/19), my wife saw what she described as a triangular shaped object move rapidly east to west across the sky.  She said it was gray in color with large glowing lights at each point. It traveled in a straight line and was visible for approximately 6 seconds. Three nights later (12\/22\/19) we were in the tub again.  A few minutes after entering the tub my wife yelled \u201cThere\u2019s something in the sky!  There\u2019s something in the sky!\u201d this time I saw it too. She described it as a boomerang shaped object with smaller glowing lights. It was visible for about 5 seconds. I was unable to discern a shape myself, but could see the dimly lit lights. The odd thing about it, aside from the experience itself, is that these sightings were almost at the exact same time each night (18:10).  The sightings were at night with a clear star lite sky behind them.  These objects did not make any noticeable sound.","2457":"I was driving home from work when I looked up and I could see an oval shaped UFO looking aircraft being followed by a helicopter. It has a few very bright lights so bright I could see the aircraft was metal. It flew pretty low to the ground, I gained speed and I could see it going far away but then when I took a turn all of a sudden I saw it in front of me and the helicopter lost it. I then saw it lowering down to the ground, so low I couldn't see it behind some houses about 1000 feet away when I drove past the houses where the UFO was I saw it flying at the same distance from the ground foward and then it gained speed losing track of it. The UFO had a long strip of a white light and a yellowish light on the front. Also when I came home there were two fading lines in the sky.","2458":"Helicopter Pursues two lights over White Lake, Michigan at high speed At approximately 18:45 traveling east on M59 in White lake Township, two lights, one white and a smaller light more of an orange color fly overhead of traffic followed by a helicopter. I\u2019m not sure what size the lights were in relation to the helicopter but the larger white light was maybe half the size of the chopper. I thought the crafts were a formation of some sort but the orange light traveling next to the other larger light threw me off, because there were no blinking lights and no usual shape I could make out of the two. all three craft were traveling at high speed and after the trio started getting further ahead I notices that the orange light was getting smaller and fainter, it wasn\u2019t visible at all after about 30 seconds after the initial contact. I could still see the blinking chopper lights still chasing the brighter white light until they both exited my frame of view. I wouldn\u2019t have thought anything of the sighting if the small orange orb didn\u2019! t dissipate out of nowhere, it didn\u2019t make sense.","2459":"I was travelling on Loop 202 Beeline Highway heading West . Coming from the South were two perfectly round dull green lights on opposite ends of each other but directly across from each other about the distance of a medium to small size airplanes wing span.  These two lights did NOT blink at all and they were not bright like a conventional aircraft or helicopter as to be used for the purpose of seeing out ahead of where it was going. There were  (zero) no other lights whatsoever on this UFO. As it approached closer towards the highway and right when it got almost directly above me the light on the right side (as Im looking at it coming towards me) turned a reddish color and with the same dim and dull appearance. The craft that was flying was completely dark ,so i couldnt make out the actual shape of it. I thought I seen a quick glimpse of the craft as a other source of low light reflected off of it and It appeared to be like a flat triangle shape. The color ! of the craft was a grayish dull steel appearance with intricate box shaped  or square parts on the exterior located towards the center . I know it sounds like I seen alot but I really didnt and it happened so quick that the only image i have in memory to describe it. The craft also wasnt very high off the ground . It was a few hundred feet in the air . I completely lost sight of it after it flew over my car towards Red Mountain . After that main sighting there were 4 seperate bright super bright lights that hovered out South of Phoenix and North West of Phoenix.  2 each on each side of the 202. There were multiple helicopters flying out between these white lights as well as commercial aircraft coming in and out of Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. The Airplanes and Helicopters are extremely easy to identify whether they are far or near. There was alot of activity in Phoenix at 7pm . I hope others that witnessed what i seen has the inclination to report it as well .. I got footage! of the white lights (4) of them on video on my camera phone. ! I wish I could of captured the dull green lights on the craft that was super close to me, but i wasnt thinking fast enough to get that . that one would even have the Pope believing without a doubt there are UFOs","2460":"Triangular shaped unidentifiied object with green,red,whit light  hovering in sky in Montgomery county pa Object only hovered and was triangular in shape with green and red lights ....object has now moved slightly and is still hovering but with white and green lights ...there are now almost a hour later a total of four with green and white and one with red litghts ..dogs began frantically barking provoking neighbors to come outside as well","2461":"Line of lights It was a line of 5 lights moving in formation then standing still they the lights separated","2462":"Sighting was at 7:40 pm, Saturday December 19th, 2019, In Belleville, KS.\u00a0   As I was driving west down Hwy 36 with my 12 year old daughter, I noticed a bright star\/planet in the sky. Then I noticed it would fade as it traveled up in a 45 degree angle. I pulled over into an empty lot and started watching. That is when I noticed it was a pattern of lights traveling in this angle. As one Began to burn brightly above the tree line out of no where and start going up, the one before it would get lighter, the one\u00a0 before that would get dimmer, and the last would burn out. My daughter stepped out from the van to see what dad was watching and started yelling, \"what is that?\" All I could say with disbelief was, \"I don't know... I don't know\"   We watched as this pattern continued for 30 seconds or more. I tried to take film, but my phone would not get a clear shot because of the street lights. It almost looked like it could be a large spinning object because the lights would just start in the atmosphere and move from south west to north west in that same angle 20 feet above the tree line. the objects were not rising from earth, but starting in the sky and ending in the upper part of the sky line. The pattern would start left and go right. and when the last Light started up, it was a bigger and brighter golden ball then the others and took longer to fade out as it went from south west to north west in night sky. it was just amazing to watch these lights start glowing out of no where and move left to right. I have included a picture I put together of what we saw and in the horizon area we watched it. best part was my daughter was able to witness this too.  My daughters report: \u00a0Dec 21 2019 Belleville KS 7:40 pm:\u00a0  I thought it was weird that my father pulled over and yelled at me to get out of the car. What I first saw it as\u00a0 was either a drone or a missile. But it couldn't have been a drone since it was the size of a planet. The objects seem to be going in a 45 degree angle as I was facing\u00a0 west. A shooting light of objects that seemed to ba a bright glow with a fade off of blue.   They seemed to keep coming one to two seconds after each other. There seemed to be about 12 to 15 objects. They seem to have the same lighting as a roman candle. But started from the middle of the sky. They almost seemed to be a rotating item. They all seemed to be traveling in a straight line and just fade off.  The main witness,  is a vault\/ funeral technician\/ headstone cutter Second witness, junior high student","2463":"There were 6or 7 circles going around and around.No lights just circles.Floating right in front of the building.After an hour the sky was clear and had the stars out.Than at 2am the circles were back again.","2464":"I noticed a large bright pulsating amber light moving from south to north at a steady rate, after 5 minutes it stopped and became stationary in the night sky.  I now observed another bright object come into view moving in the same direction as the first but at a lower altitude.  When the second object got close to the first object, it started moving again, but changed its heading to the northeast.  The second object followed on the same course. I watched the two bright amber lights travel northeast until they became so dim I lost sight of them.  There was no sound associated with either objects. At the time the cloud ceiling was 4800 AGL(Above Ground Level),we are at 4047 MSL(Mean Sea Level) there was plus ten miles visibility, no moon, no stars.  I am a commercial pilot\/flight instructor with 10,000 plus hours of flight time and I have never seen anti collision lights that bright and amber on any airships in all the time I've been aware of the night sky's along with airplanes flying at night.","2465":"Upon leaving a friends house around 10:30pm, we walked outside the front door (facing east coming outside) and noticed a blinking light in the sky which was about 2miles away and around 300-400ft off the ground headed in our direction. The light was blinking red, white, and green in the same arythmic display as a modern commercial airplane, but very bright, much brighter than normal craft. However I passed this off as a plane, being an 8yr airforce vet I was around all sorts of aircraft and nothing caught my attention of being abnormal.  But then the aircraft banked left very hard, not a curved or even slightly tight bank that of a small single engine or even that of a helicopter, but an almost 90\u00b0degree turn and speed up very quickly heading north. The object continued to speed up and then banked left again heading west. It did not slow down or take a wide turn, this time it was a direct 90 degree turn. It traveled west for about 1mile in the matter of seconds. At this time the craft came to a dead stop. And when I mean dead stop I mean from a couple hundred miles an hour to complete stop with ZERO deceleration before stopping.  At this time the my wife and son are very afraid and get in the car begging me to get in. I am personally just in complete awe and excitement because I have never witnessed something behave in this nature. To me this was completely impossible and only something you see through CGI in movies.  The craft sat in place for about 5seconds and then continued heading west again slowly at first but picking up speed. I would estimate the craft traveled another mile before stopping completely in place yet again for maybe half a second then turned left again heading south at the same speed it was before it stopped. It then traveled for another 3-400yds very quickly before coming to a dead stop again and hovering in place for another 10sec.  It slowly headed west for maybe 100yds and then banked right, heading north, leaving my line of sight behind the house in front of us. I jumped in the car and tried to get my wife to follow it. Her and my son were extremely scared and worried and she ignored my wishes to try and follow the object. I never gained sight of the objec6 again.","2466":"Very large bright (white Light) object falling down out of sky at a controlled rate, did anyone else see it?","2467":"A cigar-shaped object flew overhead leaving a trail before landing. I looked out of my bathroom window and saw a cigar-shaped object with a comet-like contrail following behind it. I called my family out to the balcony to see it. After a few seconds of everyone seeing it, it stopped making a contrail, hovered for a moment, then quickly landed.","2468":"At first I thought it was a meteor but then changed color then disappeared.  Flew straight across left a trail of different colors then vanished.i took video and pictures.","2469":"Every Night, Multiple Sightings. Peacekeepers! Multiple peaceful flying craft witnessed that were not traceable on any of the flight reporting networks. These appear in many areas of the Sky, in various altitudes, and speeds. The physics and direction they fly in do not comply with standard aircraft. I have seen them as single craft at-a-time but many in the sky at once (up to 15 one night) on different flight paths. this morning there were 8-12 within a manner of minutes, one after another until one last one flew by and crossed paths with the last 2. Shortly after the sunlight broke, I witnessed 3 (three) man made airplanes all in \u201cpursuit\u201d but headed in the opposite direction from which the other craft were headed. I have honestly seen hovering or what looks like a star\u201d nearly every single night since December 5, 2019. December 18, 2019 One flew low enough across Silas Creek Pkwy at Country Club Rd. Bridge that I saw the BEAUTIFUL multiple colored lights on it as he flew over with such clarity and wit! hin 50-75 feet above me.

Object jetisoned another smaller object and it went off out of site. See images for details.","2471":"Oval shaped glowing white object leaves a trail of 'smoke' in the sky then vanishes . I observed one oval shaped craft heading easterly in the sky. At first it appeared to be a jet of some sort but it was moving sporadically in the sky in a continued forward motion (up and down). It let behind a trail of \u2018smoke\u2019. At this point I was thinking it was some sort of meteorite or maybe a fireball. The color was white. As soon as I came to this conclusion is when the object stopped in the sky and it appeared to have some sort of white haze, almost like a fog develop around it. As soon as this happened the trail of \u2018smoke\u2019 ceased to be produced. The object grew brighter and moved ahead then absolutely just vanished. I was able to record about 2 \u00bd minutes from my cell phone. The initial event that caught my attention was not recorded because I was really dumbfounded by what I was looking at in the sky. As soon as the object started to disappear is when I started recording so the video only shows the faint object and the trail of \u2018smoke\u2019 which shows the trajectory of the objects movement. I took one still shot when I arrived to work that only showed what was left over from the \u2018smoke\u2019 the object produced. It was oval in shape and had a bright white glow. I could see no details other than the shape and the glow. Its shape was very distinct and it did not have wings from what I could tell. No blinking lights or anything of the sort that would make it identifiable as a jet or a helicopter. The sky was clear and it was in fact dark just before sunrise. I will email the photo and video evidence.","2472":"Possible jet with cigar looking Sharp no lights and bursting light speed.","2473":"I was driving to work I had my daughter and mother in the vehicle with me as we all work together at same place. I seen a orange light in the sky, my mom thought it was a plane but me and my daughter thought it was definitely not! Next thing you know the light has a trail behind it rapidly growing longer and longer it had colors inside the trail of whites and orange and yellow and it was stretching across the sky not up or down. As the trail got longer the orange light disappeared. I was looking for anything in the news and found nothing, no rocket, no comets, zilch. But 32 miles away my boyfriend captured a video of the same sighting.","2474":"Light traveling across the sky leaving white trail behind. Then a bright flash and the object was gone.","2475":"watched object travel across sky and quickly gain speed and suddenly disappear My Mother and I were turning into Bons Secours St. Francis Hospital and noticed a bright flying object in the sky with a distinct illuminated trail behind it. At first we thought it could be a plane reflecting the suns light until we realized the sun was still not in sight. We watched the object travel across the sky and then witnessed it start dissipating and then saw it appear to \"go into hyper speed\" and quickly disappear. The flight path\/trail was clearly visible for up to 5 minutes after the sighting. Also captured some of the event on video.","2476":"Three or four bright lights, atleast, very high in sky in perfect formation, traveling higher and faster than the jets in the sky. Three or four bright lights very high in sky in perfect formation, traveling higher and faster than the jets in the sky.  Only saw bright lights, no aircraft figures.  Only saw limited sky surface due to building obstructing my view.

Three sets of three lights in a row, turning on then completely dissapearing. One set of three came as close to the beach as to where waves start breaking and lit up, one light at a time and then lights out and nothing. Just completely vaporized. There was nothing to see; not like a car shining it\u2019s brights then turning them off. The lights did not cause my pupils to make light impressions after they turned off, into the dark sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Problem with the time of the sighting.  PD))","2478":"I was driving down Arlington Road, heading towards Ellettsville from the North side of Bloomington. I noticed a helicopter flying semi-low and thought that was odd for that area but ignored the oddness. I then looked to the right side of the sky and saw the large sphere\/ball in the sky. It wasn't moving, just holding it's position in the sky. I noticed that helicopter I saw was flying AWAY from this craft. It was a large silver\/chrome ball and I only saw it because the sun was reflecting off of it like crazy! I tried to grab my phone and it totally vanished.  Cloaking or some kind of invisibility as it didn't move at all.  Once I got pulled over,  I noticed other planes in an odd area (not a normal fly zone, never see planes around here, no hospitals or helicopter pads, no airport, etc.) and it was so high up I could barely see the dark  colored plane. Didn't see the silver sphere after that.","2479":"On the way to work this morning we noticed a bright trail of something that at first we thought was a chem-trail. It was too bright and wide for such.Toward the end of the white trail it gathered up, looked to be a triangle shaped object at the start.

One by one and just like somebody turned off a light switch, they\u2019re gone.","2483":"Orange lights in triangle formation My wife and I were driving home from dinner last night and saw orange lights in the sky.  There were three lights in a triangular formation flying NNE at typical small aircraft speed.  The formation did not change as the lights moved across the sky.  Once the three were out of sight or turned east and lights were not visible, three more flew along the same flight path one at a time and disappeared at roughly the same point.  There was no noticeable sound associated with the fly over.","2484":"Bright light in the sky I seen a fixed light in the sky that slowly faded away only to come back brightly.  It appeared to hover is the same location with a slight movement left to right at times and up and down.  I witnessed it for approximately 20 minutes, but recorded about 1.5 minutes of it.  It caught my attention when it got very bright which is what made me notice it in the first place.","2485":"A dozen or more non flashing lights disappeared into darkness after flying up in formation one by one, stars visible all around. Not sure if it was a military convoy or what but about a dozen or more bright, non flashing lights were seen traveling upwards at a high angle then before even going all the way up, slowly disappeared one by one after reaching certain altitude. No clouds or visibility issues, stars visible behind and all around lights. Odd for them to disappear in such a manner after flying seemingly visibly for thousands of feet upward, in formation one by one. Noticed other flashing passenger aircraft lights very close behind ( ufo being between me and aircraft) this formation as if unaware of their very presence.","2486":"2 sets of 6 large rotating white lights in Hewlett, N.Y. i was putting the trash out at about 8 pm on 12\/20\/19.

The light was white, but not very bright and shining down into the bottom of the cloud like it was coming from inside of the cloud. Just east of these, there were another 6 lights rotating counter clockwise. They were of the same white color and also not bright. There was no noise that I could hear. I went inside to call my wife and she also saw them. We couldn't believe what we were seeing.

THEY WERE NOT DRONES. DRONES DONT FLY AS HIGH AS THESE WERE GOING. These bright red lights floated one by one into the highest point in the sky PASS THE CLOUDS. One by one they floated out of philly until there was about 25-30 of them hanging in the sky. THEN THESE LIGHTS FORMED A TRIANGLE AND DISAPPEARED!!!!! NOT A DRONE. People in other establishments in the area were outside recording on their phones and pedestrians stopped to stare and even cars on the r! oad stopped to stare.....

SOMEONE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TELL ME YOU LIVE IN THE AREA AND SAW WHAT WE SAW.","2496":"While enjoying our outdoor firepit, I first noticed 3 aircraft (no noise or typical aircraft strobes) travelling SW to NE in a steady straight path and evenly spaced. These lights weren't bright, their flight path was high. As each light reached a certain point, they would dim then disappear. This continued for 10-15 minutes. My entire family saw, we even showed the neighbor. Planes appeared to investigate.","2497":"Line of at least 14 lights traveling east in a single line. Tonight, at approximately 1830 on December 21, 2019, we were walking across a parking lot at the Grand Canyon Inn in the town of Valle, north of Williams, Arizona. We looked up and saw what we thought was a satellite moving from west to east. Then we noticed another one behind it which we thought was odd. We kept watching and counted 14+ of these same objects, each with a steady non-flashing whitish light, evenly spaced and flying in a line behind each other. On the form above, I called it a formation since the dots of light were all flying in a line. LWe have no idea what to think of them. Any ideas?","2498":"I saw what appeared as lights moving in a straight line on a NNE flight pattern.  The lights did not blink or waiver. They were even spaced and seemed to be at same speeds. These were not aircraft. No blinking lights and no sound.","2499":"Straight line of lights at varying intervals moving from South to North.

I saw what first appeared to be a satellite, a small, star-like light moving, unblinking across the sky from W-N-W towards N-N-E . I noticed another one a hands-width away, and then another and another. We watched for approximately five minutes as the lights moved in sync, equidistant apart disappeared around the star Cyg in the constellation Cygnus.","2501":"Approx 7pm on Dec 21, 2019 i was outside and noticed what i thought was maybe a big meteor or similar object. It was very big and bright white colored light in the N.E direction of the sky. It was VERY clear since the moon was not visible. It was the only light in the entire sky at the angle we were seeing it from.  It would hover, then move, hover & start moving again for quite a few minutes(5). Then it just suddenly just took off across the dark sky. My mother and I both witnessed this amazingly bright and odd acting \"ufo\". The moon is not visible tonight and it was about a 30% visibility in the sky but this light was extremely obvious. You couldn't miss this thing. Within the first 2 mins of this sighting we also saw 4 military planes heading(VERY close together)coming from the West heading to the N.E. direction this light originated from. The size MASSIVE & it was so noticeable in the sky it was strange. After about 5 mins watching the light pi! cked up speed and just simply zipped very quickly completely across the viewable sky. It was heading SW. We watched in total about 8-ish mins until it was no longer visible at our location. This was NOT the ISS, nor was it an aircraft we're familiar with. It would glid, then hover, then it would glid again,then hover...it repeated this for the majority of the time it was observed. The 4 airplanes we seen were making a very quick B-line to the NE sky. It was obvious they were together as well as they were heading to rd the same destination with clear hast. I've seen anomalies in the sky quite often lately but I've never witnessed something as massive or as obvious as this was. It was AMAZING. The lights were a bright white color, the shape was hard to make out but did seem like a sphere shape. There were no sounds from this object heard. It did actually have a aura around it, kind of similiar to a fog that faded out. The entire sphere was illuminated from our location. All o! ne color. The light did seem to brighten, then fade .... Then ! brighten and fade, it repeated this pattern until it quit hovering. When it would brighten the light would increase in size but the color remained the same. It was Unnatural lighting, anti gravity movements and impossible speed. It went from one end of the sky to the other within about 3 mins and was SO big and bright it IMMEDIATELY was noticeable and odd. It was drastically different and unusually bright from any the norm that anyone actually looking would have seen this with amazing ease!","2502":"Just west of Jupiter an orb shot up and to the left. It was floating. Another one popped up and floated the same direction. This happen 6 times.They were never in the same location so it wasn't a repeat item. I ran in got my binoculars and spotted 12 more. I could follow the round orb across the sky with my binoculars. They were never in the same area nor the same angle of flight. I know what satelights are and these were not satelights. They were to big and to fast. They flew just above jupiter lower right to upper left. I ran in got my phone and tried to record a bunch more. I video taped for 20 minutes. I dont know if you can see them? The video isn't that good. It was amazing. Hair on my whole body stood up. Wow! Is all I can say","2503":"We watched about 20 star\/satellite type lights moving from West to East while camping at Picacho Peak State Park and facing North.  They were in a formation pattern appearing one by one above us, traveling at the same speed and disappearing one by one to the east. There was no flashing light, had the brightness of stars and did not break their pattern.","2504":"Orange lights in sky orange spheres in sky, moving in a line up and fading in sequence","2505":"Each object glowed reddish in color the entire time of viewing. 4 red lights dancing in the sky. Two middle lights were rotating around each other at times. Two outer lights moved slowly in & out towards middle lights.  Suddenly one outer light very quickly disappeared followed by 2 middle lights traveling at high speed quickly disappeared. 4th light stayed another minute then just vanished.  We were on Central Ave at the time.","2506":"Saw a Fireball UFO glowing Red\/Orange. It moved around in all directions.  Very cool!  The last time I saw a Fireball UFO was in Great Falls, Montana, on the 4th of July 2012.","2507":"Lights in a row Three of us saw 15 same shaped white lights in straight line spaced at the same distances apart  heading at North east 30 degrees very high  altitude .

I was driving through Deming NM and about 30 miles prior I saw a hovering object out to the south of Deming. I couldn't figure out if it was a blimp or a weather balloon but it was stationary. As I got to Deming it was in the same area but it did appear to have moved a little bit further south. I took pictures of it with my phone and it appeared roundish from that view. I went into the store...came out and it was still there. As I drove West on I-10 I got a different and better view of it. It wasnt round. I stopped on the side of the road and took more pictures. It was either white or Silver and it looked like it had 2 areas on it. Not round. There were no wings or propellers and it just sat there moving a bit back and forth but nothing drastic. It just propelled there. I don't believe it was a drone. What could stay up there that long? It had to be at least 1000 feet in the air and it wasnt small. At least the size of a commercial plane.","2510":"I stepped out back and saw a straight line procession of &quot;Stars&quot; ... I called a friend 30 miles to the south of me and he and I stepped out back and saw a straight line procession of \"Stars\" ... I called a friend 30 miles to the south of me and he and his wife saw them too. I called my mother, 60 miles north of me and she could not see them.","2511":"string of lights evenly spaced moving across sky Went outside in the dark to see friend off. Looked straight up and saw a light moving way high up, looked like maybe a satellite it was that high up.  Clear skies, dark.  I noticed light behind it about 12\" holding hands straight out.  Lights moving SE direction over Cold Springs.  I then noticed another light and panned my view to the NW to see a continous line of these lights evenly spaced all moving across the sky in a straight line.  I counted about 30 before it was over.  They appeared to be gaining altitude until I lost sight.","2512":"satellite like looking objects single file line, orderely flying in perfection, 30 or so of them, wow!!!!! I was looking at the night sky when I thought I saw a satellite, I watched it for a few seconds before it disappeared, I then noticed several more following in the same direction, all equal distant apart, I counted 30 in a row that were going West to East","2513":"OBJECTS APPEAR AS SATELLITES IN FORMATION 30 BRIGHT OBJECTS IN A FORMATION IN LOW ORBIT GOING EQUAL DISTANCE APART FROM SW TO NE AT 6PM SHARP - NOT SATELLITES SAW SEVERAL MORE AFTER THE PASSED IN ALL DIRECTIONS","2514":"31 UFOs seen traveling SW to NE in a mostly evenly space row, one after the other. Another traveling alongside & disappearing. Today it rained a little, but the sky had cleared quite a bit. I was standing in my yard with my dog, looking toward the sky, looking at a planet and first stars of the night. At about 6 pm I saw the first 3 stars traveling evenly spaced in a row. There was a small gap in spacing, then one after another light after light traveled in a row. I watched 31 lights evenly spaced traveling in a row from SW to NE.  One light traveled alongside one of the lights in the row, then went off into a different direction.","2515":"Lights in sky in straight line at satellite heights moving very fast in easterly direction.","2516":"The objects looked very high altitude Moving south to north I must have counted at least 25 lights moving across the sky pretty evenly spaced. Seemed to last forever","2517":"There was a line of very noticeable lights  traveling north east over middle Illinois. There were 20-25 lights in a very evenly spaced straight line. After about what I would call 4-5 mins they would disappear in the same spot and same way they showed up.","2518":"8 lights flying South to north equal distance from each other and disappeared as they reached an apex in the sky. We were outside letting our pets go to the potty.  We were looking up at the sky remarking how clear it was and how many stars were out.  Then it was asked what constellation\/formation \u201cthat\u201d was \u2013 and we noted 7 lights, equal distance apart flying from south to north in a straight line.  We watched the lights travel and after they go to a point in the sky \u2013 they disappeared.  I did note that there were 8 because after we counted the initial 7 \u2013 there was an additional one that did appear to come a bit after the first 7.  We watched and looked to see if these lights\/planes had gone behind a cloud \u2013 but it was clear there was nothing.  They were just white lights \u2013 no flashing and no noise.","2519":"The event was already occurring when I became cognizant. Numerous lights that appeared at first to be distant stars quickly became apparent that they were organized in a single file line. All lights were moving at the same speed and were evenly spaced in the line. Only 6 or 7 visible at a time. All lights appeared in the same location of origin and disappeared in the same location of exit. A second eye witness joined mid way. Watched the same event unfold until no more lights appeared. The final light observed seemed to linger for a moment before disappearing in the same location-perhaps in pursuit?","2520":"As I stood on my balcony, I saw approximately 40 bright lights evenly spaced moving in single file from SW to NE across SW Missouri. At 18:30 I was out on my balcony and was looking up in the night sky at the stars. I spotted a bright light going across from SW to NE. I then saw another and another and another they were evenly spaced apart and traveling at the same rate of speed. I stood there watching and noticed that they were coming from the SW. I stayed counting them I got up to 15 and thought this is no way planes or helicopters for they all had just a single bright light. I couldn't get a good video or picture due to the darkness and they wouldn't show-up. I then ran and got my Son to come and see them not knowing if they would be there once I returned with my Son as a witness. We got back out on the balcony and they were still there just as before. One after another and up to 40 of them I also noticed planes flying around the same area with their blinking white and red lights and I could till the planes were at a lower altitude then all the single white bright lights were that were! going across the night sky.  After the single file white bright lights stopped I stayed watching the same areas to see if anymore came as the first set. And, if anymore sightings of planes in the same area. I then witnessed 8 more of the same single bright light going in the same direction as the multiple ones. However, I could tell these were higher up then the other ones and further apart then as they got just passed my backyard tree line I saw a bright flash of a few of them then they were gone. I went back inside and went to see if anything was posted online from any other sources. This was at 17:15 and I found your site and decided to post this. A feedback to my sighting would be appreciated if another reports should come in.  Thank you,","2521":"String of white lights that disappeared into a triangle shaped object and a flashing light appeared and the light flew off quickly Long string of 15-20 lights staying in a straight line until they reached a triangle of lights about the same size and brightness and all disappeared at the same point and more lights came from other directions and all disappeared in that area once again, also there were clouds in the sky, about 20 minutes later a few more emerged and disappeared at the same triangle of stars although they came from different directions, shortly after they disappeared a light started flashing in that area and shortly after jetted off in a bright white streak of light . The witnesses were myself, my dad who was in the military for many years, and my mom","2522":"Line of 8 to 10 spheres, star sized lights traveling southwest to northeast across the horizon, perfect line and distance between each My wife and I were out walking the dog tonight at 6:30 PM, 18:30 hours when we looked to the southwest, a line of lights we\u2019re moving in the sky, perfectly spaced distance between them, and going to the northeast. I have watched the International Space Station travel overhead many times which is approximately 250 miles above in orbit. Theses objects appeared much higher up, the same size as stars, traveling in a straight line, at least eight of them stretched halfway across the horizon and traveled perfectly spaced apart to the northeast. It was stunning to see these objects, they looked like a whole new constellation of perfectly aligned stars, only they were moving fast inline. The objects travel across the horizon for about 10 minuets, continuing northeast until we lost sight of them.","2523":"Il. 14 bright objects thay appeared like stars in the sky evenly spaced with no sound or blinking lights. I was walking our 2 huskies and to the west of our home on the 7000 south rd. I noticed a string of what i thought were stars forming a constellation until i realized i have never seen this particular formation in the sky. the reason i thought they were stars at first , is because they did\"nt  blink like strobes on typical aircraft do.So when i stopped and picked a fixed object in the sky, i could see that all of the objects were moving in a straight line, evenly spaced apart and moving from the southwest to the northeast. There was no jet engine noise like the air traffic coming from O'hare and Midway airports. The other strange thing i noticed , is when eachn of the objects reached a certain area of the north easterly direction they were all travelling, they disappeared one after the other until they were all gone. The objects i observed were to high in the night sky to determin if they were saucer, cigar shape, or for that matter , maybe high altitud! e bombers or fighters flying in military formation and when they got to a certain altitude, they all turned off their landing lights one by one. I don't know what i witnessed, but for all of the years we have lived out here in the country and all of the times i have looked to the stars, i have never seen anything like i did tonight. I was the only witness to what i saw because by the time i got back to the house to get my wife to come outside to witness what i had seen, They were gone .","2524":"Star like lights moving from west to east in straight line, in night sky. At 6:35 PM , while walking my dog in my back yard I often watch the sky.  Tonight I saw something I have never seen before.   Approximately  7 lights in line from the horizon straight up. These lights were much like stars.  No flashing, just like moving bright stars. It was a clear, no moon night sky. Then I realized they were slowly moving.  As they moved the first would disappear but another (nearest the horizon) would appear.  I realized they were actually moving from west to east, but at a very slow speed and high altitude.  So slow that at first I wasn\u2019t sure they were moving.  I called my husband out to see it too.  It lasted a good 15 minutes, until they all disappeared, one by one never veering from course.  We live outside of a small city and can see the night sky.  Also there was no sound from them.","2525":"Lights in night sky moving in a straight line formation 5 lights maybe more. Moving from South to North in a straight line, hundreds of feet apart. At first look they seemed like  stars, however they were all moving in a straight light faster than a plane flies at a high altitude. When they got to a certain point in the sky, the lights just disappeared one by one.  There were no clouds in the sky on this night.","2526":"A stream of slow moving lights coming from the west and disappearing as they flew overhead. Looking to the west above the horizon at about 18:35 several of us saw these lights coming from the west.  One after the other spaced about a minute apart they would come from the west in a straight line then disappear as they got about overhead.  This went on for about 15 minutes.","2527":"Lights in night sky moving in a straight line formation 5 lights maybe more. Moving from South to North in a straight line, hundreds of feet apart.

Initially thought of multiple airplanes traveling on the same IFR, until I noticed the lights never blinked.  Somewhere between 20 and 25 lights were spaced approximately the same distance apart and were traveling in the same direction.  At one location in the sky the lights would becoming dimmer until they disappeared.  They all disappeared at the same physical location in the sky. I could not capture video because my camera could not focus on the dim lights.","2529":"12 starlike lights traveling faster than an airplane separated equally and would disappear in the same spot. 12 starlike lights traveling from the southwest going towards the north. Separated in equal distance and traveled faster than an airplane would. They would travel so far and then disappear in the same spot. Then there was one last light that traveled behind and did the same thing.","2530":"There were approximately 15 circular lights in formation coming from the west heading East. Then the lights would disappear at the same spot in the eastern sky into a triangle shape of stars.. Then one would appear from the west coming East. It to disappeared into a formation of triangle shaped stars. This went on every 2 to 3 minutes.","2531":"Observed at least 20 dimly lit craft ,incoming into our solar system at a great range out. The craft were evenly spaced out in a   line stretching nearly from horizon to horizon. They were perfectly spaced out and traveling at the same great speeds in formation. The flight came out of the South West and was headed north east.  Surely with all or telescopes, some one besides my fried and I witnesses this.","2532":"My stepdad was outside when he saw a line of bright lights that seemed to be moving from North to South. The lights were very small, but he knew something was off about tthem. Once he had me outside I looked up to the sky and I too saw the line of lights. Before he told me he thought they were moving I brought it up. He told me to go get the binoculars to get a slightly better look. When I came back out and looked up I started to shake immensely. I saw that they were moving very fast. As I watched the front object move forward past other lights in the sky it suddenly disappeared. My stepdad had watched it disappear too because he asked me if it just vanished from the sky. Then I took off the binoculars and noticed you could see about 6 at a time in a straight line with even gaps between them moving at about the same speed. Once one disappeared another appeared on the horizon. Eventually there was only one left and we watched it as it flew then suddenly disap! peared from view. We stood outside for a couple more minutes discussing what we had just witnessed. P.s. How they just vanished from sight kind of reminded me of in Star Wars when they go into hyper speed. That by far was the scariest thing I have ever witnessed and probably will witness in my entire life.","2533":"8 lights Looking West  3 lights in a row moving slow every minute or so another one shows up until there is 8 in a row straight moving North east then all 8 dimmed out same time than gone","2534":"There were 5 to 8 lights in a straight\/diagonal line fading in and out and moved a bit Called a friend about 30 miles away and they could see it to","2535":"Three fwhite ussy lights were seen traveling in a circular pattern each one of them above the clouds and coliding before engaging in the same pattern once a gain.","2536":"I saw a line of lights going across the sky in single file heading in the same direction. once they got to a certain spot they would disappear and more would come from behind.  There was no sound and it was hard to tell how high they were but I would guess a few thousand feet off the ground.  There were no clouds in the sky so I don't know why the lights would disappear and they got to a certain point in the sky.  I'm just wondering if anyone else in the area seeing the same thing.","2537":"Weird formation towards Lansing Michigan seen from Howell Lights in semi-linear formation in western sky towards Lansing. Dimmed then brigtened and started moving higher in the sky.  One of them went upwards then backwards and down. They gradually faded out from view about 60 degrees above the horizon. They started at about 35 degrees above the horizon. They did not make noise, there was air traffic visible in the opposite side of the sky towards Detroit and Flint. These were not aircraft, we know the difference from living near an air force base when I was a child. My mother could see better than I could because she has far sharper vision than I (I'm normal, but she's got eagle eye vision). We left after they disappeared and although they didn't seem close the animals in our barn were visibly acting odd when we came in which was strange because the objects were not close, they looked like stars moving around in formation. We can't find anything in the sky constellation\/planet wise that resembles it.","2538":"It was around 7:25pm on December 22, 2019 that we were driving the family home down the I-196 (west). We were coming from Grandville, Michigan heading towards Holland and were about a mile or two from the exit 55 towards Zeeland\/Holland and US-31. As we were driving I saw 7 white lights that looked like they were lower than the majority of the stars in the sky. They we\u2019re all in a row and we\u2019re all evenly spaced. They weren\u2019t low enough to see any detail in their shape but the constant pattern and equal spacing intrigued me. It reminded me of the airport when the planes lined up to land.  As we continued driving some started to disappear and leave a bigger Gap in between the others. At one point if I remember correctly an additional light popped up but it was only for a little bit. So technically there were eight at one time. But for the most part I saw seven. After that I saw the second and third light disappear then return as bright as before. Once we reac! hed exit 55 the last two in the row faded out and by the time we passed the exit there were  only about 1 or 2 faint ones left. I tried to take photos but I was on the highway and it was too dark. At for I thought it was a Star constellation but new once I saw the number of them in a row that it most likely was not. It was very interesting to see.","2539":"A strait line of ufo going from the horizon to the sky when they reached high altitude they disappeared and when they made it half way each one lit up bright.","2540":"Looking west of Clinton single lights in row formation (8-10) showing.

I had just asked my children which star they thought was the brightest in the sky, and as I looked west, I noticed at least four bright lights traveling in serial across the sky, fading as they traveled further as if disappearing into the distance. They were traveling in a straight line, appearing perfectly spaced from one another and traveling along the same exact path. As they traveled further and began to disappear one at a time, new lights continued to appear from over the tree line until at least 10 of them had traveled along the same exact path and disappeared. The lights had the same appearance as stars, but shone much brighter and were obviously far closer. They did not move like, or appear to be, airplanes.  Based on experiences I had in the military, my initial impression was that these might have been missiles or rockets being test-fired over Lake Michigan from a launch point somewhere in West Michigan \u2013 possibly near the area of St Joseph based on where they appeared to be coming from. However, I am unaware of any launch or test sites in this area.","2544":"I was heading west on US20 and saw while driving I stopped to see a string of 6 lights heading into space horizontally in formation then they disappeared.","2545":"18 lights in a row perfectly spaced between one another in the Western Michigan Sky while looking into the western evening sky i noticed a bright light that was moving slowly thru the sky. i thought it was the ISS. It was 730pm est. I mentioned it my GF and she looked at it too...As we watched, it was one Bright light then another then another,,we counted 18 lights in a perfect row heading NE until they vanished out of sight just like the ISS  does when you watch that go past over head.Some lights were brighter than the others. I have pictures as verification.","2546":"Multiple objects in a straight line and constant heading I saw what I thought was a satellite. I was looking at the night sky - direction 330 degrees and about 60 - 70 degrees elevation. Approximate height - impossible to say. Seeing one small light HDNG approx 055 degrees across the sky. That would indicate origin being USA\/Mexico if they were travelling in a dead straight line. Sky was clear (stars visible) with minimal light pollution its direction of travel. I then noticed more \"dots\" following it. My father was with me and saw it all. We counted around 20 of these - all seemingly equally spaced. Spacing was impossible to tell (unable to establish height) but maybe 1 - 2 nautical miles. There was no sound. The strangest thing was, when they passed through around 320 degrees (travelling left to right) they just vanished.  Like going behind a curtain. But stars were visible!!","2547":"Seven uniform lights that look like stars moving highway to speed due West We were looking due west verified with a compass. There were seven lights lined up in a perfect row evenly spaced apart. Heading due west or going out of  the earth atmosphere into space. I have pictures and video of it. There were other aircraft in the area heading west as well not moving nearly the speed of the ufo\u2019s to reach the horizon. At first I thought it was the star formation of Orion\u2018s belt but realized there were seven lined up in a perfect row. My son saw it first then my wife and I and my grandson came outdoors to see it. I called my daughters boyfriend and he went outside and saw it as well he lives about 20 miles north of where I live. They all eventually faded out.  The 4th up from the bottom was the last to go.  It got really bright before it finally disappeared. They looked like stars or bright satellites.","2548":"Space crafts were flying in a straight line in the distance, disappearing above one by one.

Each of the crafts was perfectly spaced from the next. After watching and acknowledging it (verbally) they began to separate, again at perfectly even interval distances. The one highest up then shot off and, in order, they sequentially shot off and disappeared. We thought maybe they were planes, but they hovered in place perfectly for way too long to be a plane and were very bright (we initially thought they were stars). They also moved much too quickly to be any known man-powered craft. We also used a constellation app on the phone to try to determine if it was a constellation, but the app was unable to detect any major stars or planets where the anomaly appeared in the sky. This may or may not be associated, but a flock of geese began honking erratically and several dogs started barking at the same time we noticed these anomalies.","2551":"10 sec. metal rectangle moves from 20-80' dissapeared as if in though clouds with clear skies (cloaking?)

On Dec. 22, 2019 around 8:00 pm to 8:30 pm my son called me from Thedford,   Ontario, Canada  and told me to look in the west sky as there were 3 or 4 lights following each other in a perfect line moving upwards into the sky evenly spaced and once one would reach so far up it would disappear and one would appear at the bottom of the chain.  We were in Strathroy, Ontario, Canada roughly about 25 minutes away and we could also see this chain of lights.  It lasted for about 15 \u2013 20 minutes.  Then came what seemed to be planes, 4 of them with white flashing lights but one bright red light that did not flash.   They were flying in sets of 2 going in opposite directions.  Both of us could also see those.","2553":"Disc Shape Hovering, I was driving on 52 headed East\/Northeast and saw eight white lights in a row hovering in the sky. at first I thought it was an airplane but it wasn\u2019t moving. It was completely stationary. As I drove closer I could start to make out the shape of the craft as a on long spherical disc shape. I thought maybe it was a large helicopter the way is hovered but the size was much too big and it was flying too high to be a helicopter. As I started to stare at it longer, I saw what looked like an object fall from the bottom of it. I panicked because I thought it might hit the ground or injure someone but then it appeared to be just a falling star in the sky. In the sheer seconds it took for that to process in my brain, I blinked and the craft was completely gone.","2554":"Hello, My wife and I been seeing these objects in the sky since last year , it started with just one now there are about 6 high in the sky at the same locations every night , they pretty much stay in one area , you can see blinking lights on them , they are in the sky for hours at a time we are so curious what this may be, I\u2019m not saying they are ufo\u2019s put something is in our sky\u2019s every night hovering, I really would like somebody to come to our home to investigate this.
